Frequently asked questions
Are Blinq cards secure?

Each card is given its own unique obfuscated link which cannot be accessed unless someone knows the link, i.e. they receive the card.
‍
All Blinq data is protected by Google Cloud.

Can I create multiple cards for a user?

Yes, you can create different cards ready for different situations. For example, in an internal team meeting where social media links could be shared vs. in a conference setting where only key professional details might be shared. Often, Blinq users create a card with their phone number and another card without their phone number, so they can share the right card for the right situation!
‍
Users can quickly swipe to different cards and share with a recipient depending on the context of the meeting.

Linkedin for Realtors: What to share [with examples]

Linkedin for Realtors: What to share [with examples]
Social media is a powerful tool in the arsenal of any realtor. But what social media platform is the best? Is LinkedIn optimal for realtors? And what content to share? I answer these questions, show examples, and break down tips for content creation. Let’s dive in.

What is the best social media for Realtors?
If you asked me 18 months ago, I would’ve said LinkedIn and Facebook (who goes by Meta now). Today it’s definitely, LinkedIn, and maybe Meta.

So, what changed? 

Well, for starters, today iPhone users can block ad targeting. Android is said to follow. And given ad revenue is Meta’s main business model, evidenced by Zuckerberg’s famous smirk answer to a Senator, it ends up hurting the platform as a whole, as people get ads they hate, or which are irrelevant to them—making them abandon the platform.

Furthermore, because Zuckerberg and his team poured billions of dollars and tons of hours into this new identity revolving around AR/VR with products like the Quest Headset, Metaverse, and RayBan video Glasses, its older products (Facebook) suffer neglect amidst their identity crisis.

Yes, groups on Facebook are still powerful if you’re able to engage, comment, help, and give value for free as a group member, before you sell homes without building trust and rapport.

So, why has LinkedIn stayed on top for Realtors?

To be honest, I don’t know that it has. I’ve looked for properties recently in Bangkok, Thailand, and Tbilisi, Georgia—and Facebook was better when looking to rent. But when I looked for a reputable agent in order to network, learn, and buy a home, LinkedIn prevailed. Additionally:

LinkedIn is a much more organic platform, and Microsoft, LinkedIn’s owner, focuses on creators with new features like creator mode and “links in bio”. Furthermore, people genuinely show up on LinkedIn to either help (create content) or grow (learn from content). They reshare, engage, and comment more purposefully—and your feed mostly shows what your network shares and likes—rather than what some algorithm thought you’d prefer, like on Facebook. This has more oomph to it than it sounds—because trust is key in sales, and on LinkedIn.
‍

Secondly, and more importantly, it’s where your actual audience cohort. LinkedIn is a professional network, where people reading your content/ads are in the right headspace to buy a high-ticket product (think: house in the US with a median price of $420k). Additionally, in terms of demographics—LinkedIn is vastly superior. Its user's age, median income, and professional careers mean they’re much more likely to be in the market for a new house, relocating due to a job hop, or buying a new/second home, with the ability to afford it.
The catch? Quality comes with a price. 

How much does LinkedIn Premium cost?
LinkedIn premium’s cheapest tier starts at $30 a month. Sure, you can use LinkedIn for free, but as a professional agent, you’d like to have the ability to see data, analytics, and send InMails.

Examples of great posts by Realtors
Bill Gassett
Bill Gassett is a colleague and friend. Like me, he combines real estate and marketing. But unlike me, Bill attacks it from the other side—your side—the realtor’s side. 

Bill’s profile is a great example of a strong banner and profile picture. Banners are important and provide great real estate often neglected by users.


And here’s how he instills confidence and trust through multiple endorsements.


Lastly, here’s an example of a real post he shared, about a trending topic. A blog article he wrote (which’s part of his content strategy, leading from social to his blog).


Diana Kadan: sharing a client win
If you’ve had a big win, you can build client confidence and celebrate your achievement with a LinkedIn post. Diana’s post provides a great example of how you post about a purchase without having to name the clients.


Dustin Brohm: giving advice through videos
If done right, video can be an exceptionally compelling medium. Dustin Brohm posts videos on his LinkedIn to build trust and spread his influence, like this one about how to buy a house when you’re self-employed.


Frank Audano: local market data
Anyone can power up their laptop, check CNN and see reports on nationwide housing trends. But up-to-date local data? Well, that’s harder to come by. Frank Audano’s post makes his LinkedIn a source of local data for buyers in Kansas, sharing insights from a recent report.

What to share on LinkedIn
Now that we’ve seen some samples, what should you share on LinkedIn? 

Talk about your:

Success - to build authority. That big house sale. Your banking and escrow connections. Your articles, podcasts, and interviews. It all contributes to your personal brand.
Failures - to be authentic and humanize your content. Sharing defeats builds a different kind of connection. Stories like how that one time you lost that deal at the last minute because the buyer's bank didn’t approve his mortgage.
Personal experience - like how you know your area, master your zip code, and your specialty in Type A/B class properties, or relocating tech workers.
Your housing market knowledge - to show you’re intelligent, understand the bigger picture, and how the CRE, residential, and hospitality markets are connected. In times of doubt, fear, and uncertainty, talk about economical cycles, the prime rate, and inflation.
Also, lots of realtors like to share their Blinq digital business card on LinkedIn. These digital cards let your LinkedIn followers save your contact details with a click, so you’ll be on speed dial when they need to sell their home! Learn more about the digital business card realtors love.

Tips on creating content for Linkedin
You could share videos, but as you’ve seen on Bill’s post, he used a picture, because single-image-ads work best on LinkedIn. Unlike TikTok or Instagram, where video is more native, people react more positively to pictures on LinkedIn.

In terms of how to approach content creation, it’s best you use formulas of what works. Test and pivot according to your audience’s feedback. You can create Polls (a LinkedIn feature) and ask what topics they like most, and then prepare templates for yourself as I’ve done on Notion:


Now that you know what social media is best for realtors (depending on your offering), seen examples of the content shared there, and advice on how to do it yourself, you’re ready to create more impact as a realtor!

Top 8 Business Networking Tools to Supercharge Your Growth
What comes to your mind when you think about professional networking?

Handshakes, smiles, and events with other professionals will most likely be your answer. And you’d be correct—up to a point. 

While many people cringe at the prospect of attending a networking event, for others it’s their go-to approach to socialize with other professionals in their field.

But what if I told you, you could have your cake and eat it too? I’m talking about networking and meeting other professionals without leaving the comfort of your home. 

It’s all possible with the right business networking tool. 

But why’s networking so important? 

For starters, networking gives you access to the people and opportunities essential for your growth. It’s an avenue to connect with like-minded individuals in your field, brainstorm ideas and learn. And for professionals, networking is a game-changer—the key to their success. 

According to Zippia’s recent research, 79% of Americans say networking is crucial to their career progression. So it’s not uncommon to see many business professionals fast-track their careers just by having the right network.

However, despite the many benefits of networking, only 48% of people actually stay in touch with their network.

‍The question—Why does this happen?

If you’re like most people that find it hard to keep networking and making new connections, it’s mainly because of these two reasons:

You’re not using the right business networking tools
You’re approaching business networking the wrong way 
And that’s fine. Many people don’t know their way around professional networking. 

Thanks to the internet, professional networking has moved beyond in-person interactions. With online platforms and tools, you can easily connect with people, build relationships and get mentorship to grow your business.

In today’s guide, we’ll be covering top business networking tools along with five networking tips to help you make meaningful connections and build stronger professional relationships.

Top 8 Business Networking Tools
1. Blinq: Easily Share Your Professional Identity With Digital Business Cards
Shows a Blinq Digital Business Card and the Blinq Digital Business Card QR Code Sharing Screen
The first step in networking with people is exchanging your contact information. 

Blinq offers an easy way to create a memorable first impression and share your identity when networking online and in person. With Blinq, you can create a quick digital business card containing all your professional details and share it with a single tap.

Bling allows you to

Impress new contacts with QR code-powered business cards.
Personalize your business card.
Securely share your card with anyone, anyhow you like. You decide.
Customize your contacts with personal notes.
Automatically save personal information from digital business cards.
Create multiple profiles and cards.
Promote your business on the go with customized company identity cards.
Manage customer details and keep contact information up to date.
If you’re connecting with people physically, they can get your information by scanning the QR code on your phone or apple watch without even having the Blinq app.

When networking online, simply email, text, copy the link to your business card or share it any other way you prefer directly from the Blinq app.

Show's the "share your card" scren from the Blinq Digital Business Card app
Additionally, Blinq automatically adds the contact information from any digital business card you receive to your phone. It also allows you to attach personal notes to each contact. For example, you can record where and when you met, the things you talked about, and when next you’re scheduled to speak or meet.

One great feature I love about Blinq is the extensive level of customization it gives.

Shows a screenshot from the setup stage of the Blinq App on desktop
Your card can contain any kind of professional information, from your company website address to social media details and even online payment links like PayPal and CashApp. 

You can also 

switch the Blinq brand colors to yours, 
customize your QR code, 
create an email signature, and 
add virtual backgrounds to share your card over video chat.
It’s simply amazing.

Take a look at my card below. See how I replaced the Blinq brand color with mine and added my Calendy meeting link. Now, clients can book a meeting with me without even visiting my website.


And that’s not even all. 

Blinq lets you create multiple profiles and cards so you can control the information you share and with whom when networking.

My favorite part about using the Blinq card to network is that it eliminates the need to inform my network about changes to my personal information. That’s because every profile you create on Blinq is live. So, the tool automatically keeps your details up to date.

If you’re a company, Blinq business makes it easy to manage your organization’s professional identity. With up-to-date digital business cards customized to your branding, your team can network and promote your company on the go.

Blinq also integrates with CRM platforms like Hubspot, Salesforce and Azure AD. This means you can effortlessly manage your contacts and keep customer information up to date and ready for follow-up, all from a single dashboard.

So what are you waiting for?

Create your free digital business card today, and start networking.

2. Hunter.io: Find Emails of People You Want to Network With

Whether you’re meeting people online or at physical networking events, sending an email is a surefire way to start a conversation, connect, and keep a relationship going. 

To find the email addresses of people you want to network with, use Hunter.io, a successful email-finding tool trusted by millions of professionals worldwide. 

Hunter helps you find emails of specific persons within organizations. For instance, as a freelance B2B content writer and marketer, I’m always looking to connect with and pitch my services to B2B companies. 

So, with Hunter, I effortlessly find email addresses of decision makers like content marketing leads, SEO managers and marketing managers within companies I desire to work with. From there, I pitch them, make enquiries or connect with them. 

And this works for every other kind of business. 

Use Hunter’s domain search tool to find all the email addresses associated with a specific company. Then, filter the result you get by department, type or even company data.

Shows a screenshot for somone searching a company domain into the Hunter IO tool to find email addresses. 
And if you know the particular person you want to connect with within an organization, then use the finder tool to fetch their email in seconds. But that’s not all the finder tool does. It also tells you if the email address you’re searching for is verified and where it was found.

Shows a screenshot of Hunter IO in use to find someone's email address. The tool has guessed an email address with 97% certainty.
Hunter has a chrome extension you can install on your browser to quickly find emails anywhere on the web when you visit a website. If you find email addresses elsewhere, quickly pop them into Hunter’s email verifier tool to confirm they’re correct and valid.

Andrew Gonzales, the Co-Founder and President at Business Loans, says his company has had great success using Hunter to find emails for networking with decision-makers and high-level executives from various companies.

“Hunter takes the guesswork out of cold communication and replaces it with valuable data to populate our CRM database,” he says.

3. Lunchclub: Make Professional Connections, Powered by AI

Away from in-person networking events, online platforms have proved very helpful for bringing people together to connect and build relationships. 

One such platform is Lunchclub, an AI super-connector that facilitates virtual calls between business professionals with similar interests.

Here’s how it works. 

Let’s say you’re a business owner or professional looking to grow your network. When you sign up for Lunclub for free and provide basic information about yourself, your goals and your interests, the AI platform will make personalized introductions and connect you with other professionals who match your interest.

"When I was actively growing my business network and looking to meet investors, I signed up for Lunchclub. I indicated that I was interested in speaking primarily with investors, and the platform would match me with investors looking to speak primarily with early-stage business owners. I met a number of business professionals with extremely impressive accomplishments, many of whom I'm still in contact with today.”

— Calloway Cook, President at Illuminate Labs.

Every day, the platform will recommend about 10 topics and people you could be interested in following and connecting with. They are called “daily picks.”

These recommendations are based on your goals and interests. If you’re interested in connecting, Lunchclub will introduce you. Then you can start chatting away and arranging calls with users. 

To turn the heat up, put meeting people on autopilot by blocking time on your calendar. Then, Lunchclub will automatically schedule meetings for you with new people that match your profile. Just don’t forget to check the box at the bottom left corner so it can match you with people in your area.

Shows a screenshot of lunchclub's calendar feature
For a free platform, Lunchclub is more time efficient and effective for networking than meeting someone in person for coffee. 

Alex Birkett, co-founder at Ominiscient Digital, a content agency, says the connections he has made from Lunchclub have resulted in several interesting conversations, one of which became a client.

4. Slack: Communicate, Collaborate and Network in One Place

In recent years, Slack has evolved from an intra-company communication tool into a powerful networking platform. Professionals across different fields use private, invite-only slack communities to network, share job leads, and exchange career advice. 

For freelancers and other service providers, gaining access to your industry’s slack community can put you in front of hiring managers and potential clients. But that’s not all. Slack forums also present an opportunity for you to connect with industry peers, share knowledge, and learn from experts.

It, however, starts with finding the right community.

For instance, Superpath is one of the leading slack communities in the content marketing space. It’s a supportive group of marketers, SEOs, content managers, company founders and freelancers looking to network with potential clients and hires and learn from each other. 

With over 11,500 members, the Superpath community is like an insider club with a constant flow of collaboration opportunities, gigs and meaningful conversations. 

Take a look at the screenshots below.

A screenshot from a Slack community where a man called Sea n has put out. request for agency owners and project managers to share tips on managing multiple clients at scale.
A man called Jason advertising his content writing services in a Slack channel.
A screenshot of a man called Reueben asking if anyone has built a successful blog without using paid SEO Tools
By actively networking on slack communities, you can make connections that open career doors and take your business to the next level. For example, B2B SaaS writer Sanketee Kher says she has found several clients on Superpath by answering questions and sharing her portfolio. 

Other notable slack communities include Demand curve and Product Led Growth. In fact, almost every industry has a slack community. Find one that’s relevant and start making connections that’ll move your business forward.

To find slack communities in your industry, google “slack community” + your career field. Or ask people in your network about relevant groups they belong to.

5. Twitter Communities: Join Conversations That Create Opportunities and Improve Visibility

If you’re already on Twitter, joining a community can help grow your network on the platform.

Twitter communities are similar to Slack and Facebook groups. They’re dedicated forums where like-minded people meet to forge new connections and discuss issues that interest them. 

But more than chatting about fun things, Twitter communities present opportunities for collaborating with industry peers and experts while increasing brand visibility. 

By actively interacting with community members, you can build genuine relationships, stand out as an expert, and land new clients.

For instance, I landed my first content collaboration opportunity by connecting with a freelancer I met on #FreelanceChat, a Twitter community for freelancers. 

Several other communities exist within every industry. Find the right ones, engage in meaningful conversations, and make connections that can positively impact your business.

Even though Twitter communities can connect you with potential clients or customers, refrain from using them as an avenue to advertise yourself 24/7. Instead, concentrate on being helpful and adding value to the community. This way, it'll be easier to build trust and credibility, which will result in business connections, referrals and growth.

6. Newsletters: Discover Growth Opportunities, Stay Updated, and Gain New Perspectives.

Although newsletters sometimes get a bad rep, they’re an excellent medium for discovering business opportunities and keeping a pulse on your industry. 

Within every industry and niche, there’s a plethora of newsletters. While some tend to be very promotional, others focus on sharing ideas, growth/job opportunities and keeping their subscribers updated with the latest industry news and trends.

John Bonini’s Some Good Content is one awesome newsletter in the marketing industry. The practical frameworks, expert interviews and job opportunities he shares help subscribers sharpen their skills, discover industry experts to network with and grow their businesses. For example, Lily Ugbaja, the Founder of marketingcyborg.com, says she recently scored a freelance client by responding to a job posting in the newsletter. 

Also, Kaitlyn Arford, freelance writer and journalist, runs a newsletter where she shares weekly job opportunities for all things freelance.

One way to discover notable newsletters in your industry is to ask other professionals in your network. Finding the right newsletter may take some leg work. But once you do, you’ll benefit from the rich knowledge and opportunities they share.

7. Buzz Sumo: Get the Insight You Need to Create Great Content and Grow Your Network

After making connections online, the natural way to build professional relationships, keep conversations going and earn trust is by creating and sharing valuable content.

And Buzzsumo is the right content marketing tool to help you do that.

Buzzsumo takes the stress away from content creation by giving you insights into the type of content your network finds useful. 

﻿Its content discovery feature helps you find common knowledge gaps you can close with helpful, in-demand content.

This way, you can create content that answers important questions and form opinions that’ll make your network perceive you as a valuable, relevant person. And the outcome of such perception is increased connections, credibility and business growth. 

Quick tip: Sharing your knowledge and expertise with your network enhances your reputation and establishes you as an authority in your field.

8. Clay: Manage Your Network and Stay in Touch With the People That Matter

What’s more important than making new connections in business? 

You guessed right. 

It’s maintaining relationships with the people in your network. 

Successful business networking doesn’t end when you share your business card (or Blinq digital business card for that matter!) You need to stay in touch and check in regularly to increase your chance of generating referrals.

Clay, a new relationship-building software, works like a personal CRM to allow you keep in touch with your network regardless of the channel or platform you’re connected on.

Once you sign up with Clay and connect your Gmail, social networking platforms, contact and calendar, it’ll build a collection of your people so you can find all their details in one place. 

With Clay, you can say goodbye to entering contact details manually or switching between apps to stay updated about the people you’re connected to. Because Clay automatically populates all their information, including work history, photos, location etc and keeps them updated over time. 

But that’s not all. 

Clay lets you know when something significant happens to someone in your network. From job changes to special recognitions in industry publications to location changes and birthdays, you’ll get all the updates so you can celebrate your people in time.

The best part about using the networking tool is that it lets you search for your people the way you remember them. You can search by event, organization, where you met or what you talked about, and Clay will find the right person or people based on their profile and your notes. 

For example, when I search for SaaS on my Clay app, it brings up a list of my network who have SaaS in their profile and on my notes. It pulls this data from the different platforms we’re connected on.

A screenshot from the app Clay
From here, I can click on the particular person I want to reach out to, and Clay will show me all their personal information available on the web.

With Clay, you can prioritize your network into groups, stay connected and show that you care without breaking a sweat.

Now that we know the tools you need to make professional connections, and maintain your relationships, let’s look at the best practices for successful business networking.

Five Tips for Successful Business Networking
Professional networking exposes you to the collaborations, partnerships and mentoring opportunities necessary to grow your business or freelance career. 

By implementing these best practices, you’ll network efficiently and make better connections.

1. Always Give First

Lily Ugbaja, founder at Marketingcyborg
“A lot of people approach networking from a what can I get from it aspect, and that’s a shame because networking is about other people. The best deals, referrals and opportunities will come from just giving to people when you don’t need them yet.”
Networking only at the time you’re desperate for help is the wrong way to network. 

The truth is networking is both a skill and a mindset, with its most important aspect being generosity. By generosity, I mean committing your time, effort and resources to add value to people without any guarantee of immediate reward. 

When you focus on giving to others, you’ll be able to hold meaningful conversations, build and nurture genuine relationships that’ll help move your business and career forward. 

2. Be Proactive 
Networking is more than joining slack communities, connecting on Lunchclub or sharing your Blinq digital business card. 

Instead, it’s about actively seeking out opportunities to connect with people, learn from them and build relationships. This could involve sending cold emails to kickstart a conversation, joining conversations on socials, sending DMs to share a helpful resource you found or attending virtual/ in-person industry events and conferences.

3. Be Genuine and Authentic
People want to connect with real people. So whether you’re networking online or in person, be yourself. Be honest about your goals, your offerings and accomplishments. But try to avoid bragging! 

4. Always Follow Up
In networking, the profit is in the follow-up. The connections you make while networking are only effective if you follow them up and keep in touch. Following up keeps you at the top of your contact’s mind when opportunities that you’re an excellent fit for show up. Things like sending personalized emails or texts, reaching out regularly on socials, and meeting up for coffee or lunch are great ways to follow up and keep your relationship going.

5. Be consistent
Networking is a long-term play that requires ongoing effort. If you’re networking on online platforms, commit to spending at least an hour daily connecting, engaging and conversing with people. If you prefer to network at events and conferences, then resolve to attend more frequently. 

Ready to Grow Your Business With Professional Networking?
Then, never pass up an opportunity to network by getting your Blinq digital business card today.

Personal Branding for Real Estate Agents — Here’s How

Personal Branding for Real Estate Agents — Here’s How
Real estate agents can embrace personal branding by leveraging technology, social media and blogs to win the attention and trust of prospective clients. Some of the most successful real estate agents I know realize that self-branding is a key ingredient of entrepreneurship and an incredibly powerful marketing tactic. Let’s discuss why and how to build your brand as a realtor. 

Why create a personal brand as a real estate agent?
Before we dive into the how, most agents procrastinate on the why. Both beginner and veteran real estate agents know that being a part of a team, under the umbrella of a licensed brokerage, gives them an advantage. 

Essentially, as a realtor, you’re a self-employed professional. An entrepreneur. A top player in the contact sport of selling homes. Working with a team increases your odds of winning. As the African proverb says: “if you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.”

That said, you must develop your personal brand regardless of the brand identity your brokerage (team) adopted for itself—because if you ever decided to go solo, build your own team, or jump ship to a different, stronger team—your brand will go with you and even help make those changes happen. And I think you’ll agree with me saying your prospects have developed a relationship with you, not with your brokerage. They trust you, not them.

How to brand yourself as a realtor?
The most prevalent advice online on the topic is to leverage new technology. You’ll read blog advice on how to streamline back-end clutter and automate administrative tasks. Heck, 80% of the early-stage PropTech startups I work with think their tech advantage is their branding. I’ll tell you what I told them: It’s not. Sure, technology is shifting the way real estate is built, marketed, and sold. But branding starts earlier, and to find out what it means for you, you’ll have to dig deeper.

Define who you are
Before knowing who you talk, help, and sell to — I recommend self-reflection. A person’s brand is a manifestation of their values, principles, likes, and dislikes. So, who are you, really?

You can start by asking yourself these questions:

What are my values?
What are my hobbies?
Who am I as a person? 
Am I an introvert, ambivert, or extrovert?
Do I have experience in the tech industry? 
How do I make the buying process easier for my clients?
If the roles were reversed, why would I buy a home from me?
Do I have specific experience that gives me an advantage over other realtors?
The more specific your answers, the higher the likelihood your content and external communication will align with your target audience. And you want that, because at the highest levels of real estate, buyers choose agents based on their personality, vision, and values.

Next, it's time for a mindset shift. The better you position yourself as the guide, helping the hero (your buyer/seller/tenant) reach their goal (sell/buy/lease/rent), the stronger your brand will be. 

But who is your hero?

Define your target audience
If you don’t know what tone, style, principles, and values you stand for, that’s a branding obstacle; if your website's landing page, blog, and emails don't communicate it — that’s a messaging problem, and if they do but it doesn't resonate, that’s a targeting issue. And that’s why I insist you first do self-reflection, and only then set out to see who you target. 

After that first step, audience elimination is simpler (“do I even want to work with this person?”). 

But if it's your first plunge into this sort of thing — a good method will be finding patterns with those you helped most recently. For example:

‍

Where are they similar? 
Did all of them face the same problem?
Are they all within a certain age/income group?
Maybe, coincidentally, your last 15 home sales involved helping tech employees to relocate. Maybe half of them work from home now. Or maybe you'll notice most of these tech workers are from the east coast — moving westward or leaving a specific state, which you can target. These things are worth noticing. 

‍

After starting to understand your ICP (ideal customer persona), find more patterns. That'll help you cater your content around their pains; adjust your outreach filter, and even your ads.

And of course, realtors who brand themselves like to share their Blinq digital business card on LinkedIn. These digital cards let your LinkedIn followers save your contact details with a click, so you’ll be on speed dial when they need to sell their home! Learn more about the digital business card realtors love.

Is a QR Code on a Business Card a Good Idea or a Bad Idea?
By  Andrew Childress
Freelance writer
Is a QR Code on a Business Card a Good Idea or a Bad Idea?
If you found this post, I’ll bet that you’re working on your business card. You might even be wondering: is putting a QR code on my business card a good or bad idea?

Contact details like name and phone number are a must, sure. But what about more innovative features like a QR code? Is it something that’s a must-include for 2023, or has the QR code’s moment passed?

Make no mistake: the pandemic sparked renewed interest in the QR code. In a contactless world, the QR code’s role as a touch-free launch point was essential. 

But even in a post-pandemic world, QR codes serve as a valuable “next step” for the recipient. Let’s learn more about why you should (and shouldn’t!) include a QR code. Plus, you’ll learn how to create them and add them to a business card, all in this post.

Why Your Business Card Should Include a QR Code
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but every business card has an expiration date on it.

Think about it: as soon as your employer, email address, or phone number changes, it’s out of date. That means that you’re constantly handing out a card that will soon include inaccurate and outdated contact info.

The solution? Think of a QR code as the tool that ensures your business card never expires. That’s because you can use it to send a reader to an always-up-to-date set of contact details. We call this a digital business card, and it’s the perfect launch point to include on your business card.


The QR code serves as the link to your future-proofed digital business card, where your up-to-date contact details live. You can view Robert Smith’s card here.
‍

The idea here is simple: your physical business card is easy to pass out, but your digital business card gives you flexibility long after you exchange details. The QR code on the physical business card becomes your bridge to the digital business card.

Our recommended approach is to set your QR code up to link to a digital business card. Think of this as a mini-website with all of your contact details. It’s easy to adjust the details on your digital business card with a tool like Blinq. That means that every printed business card is now essentially future-proofed.

Not a programmer? Worried about building a digital business card or printing your QR code accurately? We’ve got you covered. Read on to learn more about an easy-to-use tool to create and maintain your digital business card.

When You Shouldn’t Use A QR Code
Of course, a QR code isn’t right for every business card. It’s great to adopt new technologies, but don’t let a QR code be the tail that wags the dog. 

Your QR should have a specific purpose and use case in mind. And that means thinking about what your user will see when they open the address tied to the QR code. 

Here are a couple of occasions where it might be best to avoid using a QR code:

If you don’t plan to keep your digital business card up-to-date, then the QR code can cause more harm than good. Sending the recipient of the card to an out-of-date or defunct set of details certainly defeats the purpose.
Finally, if your customer base is more traditional and less tech-savvy, putting a QR code on your business card may take up space that could be better saved for your branding.
But above all: don’t avoid adding a QR code because you think it’s difficult or time-consuming. In fact, you can do this for free with no coding or design skills needed. Keep going to learn how to create a QR code of your own. Plus, you’ll learn about a type of card that sets the standard for the future of connection.

The Best Way to Create a QR Code For Your Business: Blinq
If you’ve decided to add a QR code to your business card, you might be faced with the all-important question: how?

Remember that the best place to send someone who scans your QR code is to a digital business card. Essentially, this is a micro website that includes all of your up-to-date contact details. But you don’t have to be a programmer to build your digital business card.

With Blinq’s digital business card builder, you can drag and drop your way to a digital business card. This gives you a QR code that you can print and share with anyone. And that QR code will take a viewer to your digital business card.


Blinq’s digital business card builder enables easy drag-and-drop creation of your digital business card.
‍

Your contact details are totally customizable. Add any detail as a new field, including social media links, chat app info, and even payment links. Because these are clickable, the digital business card far outperforms its real-world counterpart.

‍


The digital business card builder creates a QR code that links to my always-up-to-date contact details.
‍

Best of all: it’s free to get started with Blinq. That means you can generate a connected QR code and digital business card at no cost.

One other powerful feature: Blinq also has a companion app for mobile devices. Think of it as your one-stop digital Rolodex. The app collects and stores digital business cards as a one-stop shop for your network. Anyone with the app has your latest contact details at their fingertips.

NFC Business Cards: The Card of the Future
Business cards that include QR codes are largely the norm in 2023. But remember: if you share a business card, it’s likely that you seek to stand out from the crowd.

If you want even less friction - literally - then it’s time to think about NFC business cards. NFC (or near field communication) cards only require a tap to launch a link to your digital business card. Tap it on a mobile device, and you’ll instantly see a clickable link.

‍


NFC business cards help your recipient tap their way to your digital business card - no QR scanning needed.
‍

Even better news: an NFC card can include a QR code. While most devices support NFC interactivity, you can’t risk missing a connection to someone with an unsupported device. By including a QR code on your printed card, you’ll never miss an opportunity to stay in touch.

NFC cards are here to stay. They give you the easiest way to connect to a digital business card. If you want to create one of your own, read on to find out how.

How to Print Your QR-Enabled Business Card
Not all business cards are built equally. And in fact, quality matters a lot when it comes to QR codes. The quality of your printed QR code impacts the scannability. Low-resolution or blurry QR codes are less likely to scan on mobile cameras.

Luckily, Blinq gives you the freedom to create printed, high-quality business cards. That also includes NFC cards that include the tech you need for no-touch connection.

‍


After you create your digital business card, Blinq also supports printing a physical version of your card that includes a QR code and NFC tech.
These printed cards are totally optimized for your QR code. They link to the same digital business card you created on the Blinq platform. Whether touchless or QR-linked, they serve as the perfect way to send a recipient your details.

Guide: how to create your NFC Business Card

Scan Your Way to Success With QR Codes
Are QR codes on a business card good or bad? If I had to pick just one option, it’s clear: these are an excellent addition to any business card. They’re easy to add and a breeze to maintain, thanks to tools like Blinq.

Remember: the QR code is the bridge to your digital business card. You can create both your QR code and a digital business card with the help of Blinq - all for free.

A Guide to Digital Business Cards for Enterprises
‍

You're the global sales lead at an enterprise company. So, as part of your role, you attend industry events to connect with peers and possible business partners. 

‍

During one of such events, you strike a conversation with a potential prospect. And just before you part ways, you decide to share your contact details with them. So you reach into your pocket for your company business card. But unfortunately, the one you have is outdated.

‍

You then remember that you ran out of the current business card earlier in the week but forgot to restock. And since the prospect is waiting, you fumble around trying to call out your contact details, ruining the business networking opportunity in the process.

‍

Now, this experience is common with enterprise businesses still relying on traditional business cards. Imagine how many opportunities and potential revenue such businesses have lost. That’s the reason why an alternative to paper business cards is necessary.

‍

And what's this alternative?

Digital business cards.

‍

Digital business cards make it easy for business professionals to network on-the-go and impact their bottom line.

‍

So today, I'll show you how digital business cards benefit your enterprise. I'll also reveal how Blinq, a digital business card tool for enterprises, can help your organization manage its professional identity.

‍

But first-

‍

What Are Enterprise Digital Business Cards?
‍

Digital business cards for enterprise’s are the online version of paper business cards. Also called virtual business cards, e-business cards, or smart business cards, they offer many advantages over traditional paper business cards. Examples include cost savings, portability, and environmental friendliness. 

‍

Unlike their traditional counterparts, digital business cards do not restrict the amount of information you can share. You have more real estate to add your company website, physical address, accreditations/awards, social media accounts, and even specific calls to action.

‍

Blinq’s Enterprise digital business card platform allows large organizations to create and distribute digital business cards to thousands of employees. They include additional security and user management features to ensure the responsible use of company digital business cards.

‍

How Do Enterprise Digital Business Cards Work?
‍

Enterprise digital business cards are powerful lead generation, lead capture, and networking tools. 

‍

They enable your teams to share company information and collect customer data in an innovative, convenient way. 

‍

Potential customers and partners receive your company information by scanning your QR code with their phones. 

‍

After that, they can immediately share their details with your team by completing a quick online form as seen below:


‍

This way, your teams can obtain contact details of potential leads without handing out and collecting paper cards that pile up and get outdated quickly.

‍

Thanks to their slick outlook, digital business cards help employees make a memorable impression and stand out when networking online or in person.

‍

📚Related➡ Digital business cards: What are they and why are they important?

‍

Despite the many advantages of digital business cards, some businesses still prefer to use physical business cards for various reasons.

‍

Thankfully, Blinq's NFC cards offer an innovative way for businesses to enjoy the benefits of digital business cards while wielding a physical card. Best of both worlds!

‍

NFC Cards v Digital Business Cards: What Is the Difference?

‍

It's common for companies to confuse digital business cards with NFC cards. In fact, we've seen it happen a lot with customers. The obvious reason is that both allow you to share who you are with anyone wherever you go. However, they have some important differences. 

‍

Digital business cards are the virtual cards you keep on your phone, tablet, or laptop. They have a QR code that recipients can scan to receive your information.
On the other hand, an NFC card is a physical tappable card you can carry around. It's embedded with a chip connected to your digital business card account. To receive your information, the recipient has to tap your NFC card on their smartphone.
‍

NFC cards eliminate the need to print multiple cards and reprint them every time company or employee information changes. Since they connect to a live digital business card profile, you can edit your information anytime, and your new contacts will receive the updated information whenever they tap your card.

‍

Other Ways to Share Your Enterprise Digital Business Card
Apart from asking customers to scan an NFC card or the QR code on their phones, employees can share their digital business cards in a few other ways.

By text, web links, or emails
Via QR codes on apple watches
Smartphone widgets
Add your QR code to posters, stickers, t-shirts, and other marketing materials.
What Are the Benefits of Digital Business Cards for Enterprises?
1. Better and Consistent Branding
Digital business cards allow you to create team card templates with your preferred information fields and brand materials. This ensures consistency across your teams. With templates, you can stay in control of the information being shared on every business card while ensuring they're always up to date.

2. Save on Card Printing Costs
According to CreditDonkey, it costs an average of $194 for companies to design and print one pack of  paper business cards. And that depends on the design, quality, and card company. Now imagine printing thousands of cards for different offices and employees. The cost can quickly add up. 

‍

On the flip side, enterprise digital business card platforms allow you to generate and share an unlimited amount of digital business cards without spending on design and printing. 

‍

Moreso, when you change company information or make a new hire, there's no need to redistribute your card or worry about outdated information being in circulation. 

‍

Digital business cards are always live. So every change you make updates across all recipient devices, keeping your information up to date.

‍

3. Improve Communication 
Digital business cards encourage future contact. Sales reps and marketers no longer have to worry about customers and partners losing their information because their contact details are saved on the recipient's phone. Now, customers can reach out long after they receive your details. Plus, the ability to customize employee business cards with their headshots helps customers connect a face to their point of contact. Thus, increasing credibility and authenticity and improving customer-client relationships.

‍

4. Track Networking Efforts and Measure ROI 
No more blind networking. Gain insights into how people interact with your business cards, so you know where and how to further connections. You can also see which employees are performing better by tracking the number of card scans. This way, you can optimize your networking efforts and spend.

‍

5. Go contactless. Go green
Statistics show that about 2 million trees are used to manufacture paper business cards every year. Plus, Adobe reports that 88% of all the business cards your teams hand out get trashed in less than a week. This report was far back in 2016, so imagine how high those numbers would be in this digitally charged age.

‍

Digital business cards, on the other hand, help companies cut their carbon footprint and behave in a sustainable way. By adopting sustainable business cards, you help keep more trees in the ground and make the planet safer.

‍

Enterprise Use Cases for Digital Business Cards
‍

Now you've seen how digital business cards can benefit your organization. It's time to share ways your enterprise can use Blinq enterprise digital business cards.

‍

1. Set up Team Card Templates and Manage Employee Access 
Enterprises usually have several offices, with thousands of employees needing business cards every year. 

‍

So you'll agree that the larger your organization, the harder it is to monitor how employees represent your brand. Also, controlling company information in circulation can become difficult as employees come and go. 

‍

But with Blinq, you can say goodbye to these concerns. 

‍

Our digital business card solution is designed to help companies maintain brand consistency. Hence, our platform comes with administrative controls. These controls allow you to set team templates with your brand colors and preferred company information. You can create unlimited templates for different departments, offices, and teams. These templates then form the foundation to create your team's digital business cards.


‍

One of the best aspects of team templates is you can prevent employees from overriding specific functions when creating their cards. Also, locking functions can prevent them from adding inappropriate information like their personal social media. 

‍

Our Growth Operations Lead, Harrison Coull, shares why enterprise customers love this feature.

‍

"Admins love the ability to lock features on the card, so there is symmetry across the team. They also love the ability to lock features off the card, preventing anyone adding personal links that aren't appropriate for work, like personal social media accounts" - Harrison Coull.

‍

Now, every team template you create on Blinq is live. This means whenever you edit a template, all the employee cards using that template will update in real-time to reflect the current information.

‍

💡[Embed]➡How to set up Blinq templates for Teams 

‍

As an admin, you can add and delete users from your dashboard. And when employees leave, you're assured of the safety of your information because you can effortlessly cancel their card and assign it to a new user. This gives you more security and control over the information being shared with your enterprise digital business card. 

‍

As our Growth Operations Manager said:

‍

"We hear from team admins that the ability to take charge, create, modify, and update team cards alleviates a lot of upkeep time for the whole team and ensures consistency of branding and information across all cards."  

- Sam Barnes, Growth Operations Manager.

‍

2. Automate Lead Capture With Powerful CRM Integration
‍

This probably sounds familiar:

‍

Your customer-facing teams attend networking events. They distribute hundreds or thousands of business cards and gather a similar number in return. 

‍

Then, they spend hours keying in the contact details from those paper cards into your CRM system or an excel spreadsheet. 

‍

How many hours of admin work do you think that costs you yearly? 

‍

Not to mention that the boring, tedious task of manually entering information is prone to errors.

‍

So, what is the better way to capture customer information? 

‍

You guessed right—Blinq's enterprise digital business cards.

‍

When potential leads share their information after scanning your QR code, their details are immediately added to your admin dashboard.

‍

You'll see their contact information, the employees they interacted with, and the day they scanned your company card. From there, you can easily export contacts to your CRM for nurturing. 

‍

Blinq automatically integrates with Hubspot and Salesforce. And we can connect to thousands of other CRM through Zapier. 

‍

To save your team some time, connect Blinq to your CRM to automatically sync and export your contacts every time they're updated.

"Teams, especially sales and procurement teams, love that their new contacts pull through automatically and smoothly to their CRM connections without them needing to interfere at all!" 

- Travis James, Growth Operations Manager

‍

3. Automate Card Creation For Teams by Linking With Your HR Directory
‍

Linking your Blinq digital business card account to an active directory like Azure AD streamlines creating, updating, and distributing team cards in bulk.

‍

When new hires join your team and the HR directory updates, a new digital business card can automatically be generated. Promotions can also be applied to employee business cards in real-time. No need to spend resources redesigning, reprinting, and distributing cards every time there's an internal company change.

4. Equip Your Customer-Facing Teams to Network at Scale
‍

Technology has changed business networking in many ways. With customers relying more on software, adopting innovative methods shows you're a forward-thinking company.

‍

Digital business cards set you apart from the competition and help your company network in a modern and effective way.

‍

With Blinq, your teams will never worry about forgetting their cards or running out when it's most important. That's because their business cards are always with them. In their phones, smartwatches, laptops, and tablets. 

‍

New contacts need not have the Blinq app to receive your company information. They can quickly scan your QR code or tap your NFC card to download your details into their phone. 

‍

During in-person networking events or marketing campaigns, you can download your QR code as an image and add it to t-shirts, billboards, and other marketing materials. This will make distributing company information 10X easier. Plus, your QR code is static. So even when you update company information, it stays the same.

‍

The thought of losing customer information or forgetting who you had conversations with also becomes a thing of the past. Now your teams can follow up easily and build better connections with leads.

5. Secure Your Data
 

Digital business cards contain your employee's personal and professional information. So, keeping this data safe is a priority. 

‍

Here at Blinq, we understand the importance of data privacy and security. So, we guarantee the safety of your information. We encrypt your data in transit and at rest and follow industry best practices to ensure a security-first approach in our software development lifecycle.

‍

We'll never sell your data. We use reputable third-party security vendors to monitor and manage security controls to meet SOC2 standards. And we review all vendors to ensure they meet the same security requirements we apply ourselves to.

Are Digital Business Cards Worth It? We Think So!
By  Akachukwu Obialor
Freelance writer

Are Digital Business Cards Worth It? We Think So!
Are you thinking of getting digital business cards, but are unsure they’re worth the investment? In this blog, I’ll outline some of the reasons I think they’re worthwhile!

As part of my research for this article, I interviewed people like you — realtors, salespeople, and small business owners — to find out why they thought digital business cards were worth it

Here are some reasons they gave:

1. They're free to update if your role or contact information changes

2. Gives unlimited space to accommodate your personal details

3. Makes it easy for prospects and customers to contact you

4. Cuts costs

5. Reduces your carbon footprint.

6. Integrates with CRM and active directories to aid follow ups

7. Facilitates networking across geographical boundaries

8. Providers like Blinq let you try them for free to make your own mind up

Digital business cards: Reasons they’re worth it
1. They're free to update if your role or contact information changes
Traditional business cards become redundant each time you get a new job title or phone number. No matter how good your old cards are, you must purchase new ones.

With Blinq digital business cards, there’s no need to purchase new cards every time your information changes. 

Simply log into the Blinq application or web dashboard. Update your information. And click save. That’s all.

2. Gives unlimited space to accommodate your personal details
An average printed business card is 3.5x2.0 inches. In most cases, it can't accommodate all your information.

In contrast, digital business cards are large enough to accommodate all details you’d like to add. And contacts can zoom in on any portion if they need a clearer view.

Amazing, right?

Take a look at the card I created:


All my professional information is on the card. None of my details are squished together or illegible. Plus there's still space to add more information if I wish to. 

Need a bit more information about digital business cards?Learn more about how digital business cards work.

3. Makes it easy for prospects and customers to contact you
I find that it’s difficult for people to contact you via paper business cards. 

Firstly, they must manually copy out your details. And they can't reach you if they misspell a  word or miss a single digit.

Also, not everyone may be patient enough to copy your details from a paper card. It takes time and focus to avoid making a mistake.

With a digital business card, all a client does is tap, and they’re immediately redirected to your social media profiles, website, payment platform, and so on.

They can even book meetings and call directly from Blinq’s Calendly and click-to-call icons respectively. This makes it easier for prospects to reach you.

4. Cuts costs
Paper-based business cards cost a lot.

A stack of 100 cards costs anywhere from $10-50 (or 0.10-0.50 cents per card), depending on the paper stock used, design elements, printing method, and whether it’s one-sided or two-sided.

I’m sure you’d agree with me that the cost is too high for a piece of paper that will likely get missing, end up in a landfill, or remain in a closed cabinet for eternity

Additionally, cards with the lowest costs have lower quality. And as a professional, your card says a lot about your expertise.

Digital business cards reduce costs in many ways.

You can create your card yourself, without hiring a graphic designer. 

All you need are your brand’s color palette and logo, links to your socials and website, and personal details you’d like to add.

Also, Blinq enables you to create your first two business cards for free. While the Premium or Business plans start from $4.99 per month.

5. Reduces your carbon footprint
Paper business cards contribute to the destruction of the environment.

A recent study reports that the paper and pulp industry is the third largest contributor to industrial pollution in the United States of America.

Also, most paper business cards end up in landfills since they’re made of glossy or coated paper, which cannot be recycled. 

Digital business cards are sustainable. They don't cause the felling of trees. And they don't end up in landfills.

So, by using digital business cards, you play your role in protecting the environment as you connect with contacts.

6. Integrates with CRM and active directories to aid follow ups
With digital business cards, you can centralize the contact information of every person who shares their details with you. This makes it easy to turn contacts to leads and grow mutually beneficial relationships. 

For instance, Blinq business’ Zapier integration connects with CRM (customer relationship management) tools like Salesforce, Hubspot, and Zoho. Your contacts can export automatically to your CRM. 

Also, you can download the CSV file of your contacts. Simply click Contacts<export contacts<download CSV from your dashboard.

This way, you keep in touch with contacts, nurture warm leads, and turn them into clients.

7. Facilitates networking across geographical boundaries
Virtual networking events and meetings are now commonplace. 

In a recent survey by LinkedIn, 28% of marketers said 90-100% of their events are now virtual. 

Digital business cards help you network during these events.

You can share them via email, text message, LinkedIn private message, and so on.


Also, Blinq lets you create a virtual background with your QR code. Here’s what mine looks like:


Anyone that scans the QR code is automatically redirected to my digital business card.

8. Providers like Blinq let you try them for free to make your own mind up
Imagine this scenario:

You pay for a large delivery of paper business cards. Upon opening the package, you discover that they don't meet your needs or preferences. The money you spent vanishes with no result.

That’s the risk of paper business cards.

No printing service offers a free trial card to let you see if the investment is worth it before you commit. 

But on Blinq's free plan, you get two free digital business cards with unlimited shares. You can give them out, measure their impact, and decide if you want to invest in them.

How to get the most out of a digital business card
Ensure your digital business card is visually appealing and easy to read
The design of your card should be attractive and professional to capture attention and present you as a professional.

When designing your card, keep these in mind:

✅ Avoid clutter: it shouldn’t be cluttered with information. Keep it clean and simple.

✅ Arrange your details hierarchically. Your name should be the first thing on your digital card. Followed by your title. And so on.

✅ Ensure the font sizes are legible

✅ Your brand and card design should align. Add your color palette and Logo.

You can use these examples of digital business cards as a guide. We’ve also got industry-specific articles for realtors, digital nomads, and photographers!

Add a high-quality headshot
A great headshot exudes confidence, competence, and professionalism. It plays a huge role in determining people’s perceptions of you.

Your headshot should align with your brand, and be of high quality to avoid pixelation.

Blinq has curated a list of 15 great professional headshots. You can use it as a guide. 

Include essential links
Provide contacts with different ways to reach you. 

This includes

✅ Social media links 

✅ Links to your Website or landing page

✅ Links to your Payment information

✅ Links to your Scheduling pages (Calendly, Google Calendar, etc)

This way, they can contact you from your business card. 

Demonstrate expertise by linking to your eBook
Including a link to your eBook card tells potential clients, partners, or employers you’re an expert. They will be more likely to trust you and do business with you.

Repurpose it 
There are different ways to use a digital business card.

✅ Share it in the bios of your social media accounts

✅ Include it in your ad campaigns

✅ Embed it on your website. We have a guide on how to embed your digital business card on your website.

Blinq lets you create your email signature from your dashboard.

Share your digital business card on social media
You reach a wider audience and increase online visibility by sharing your digital business card on social media.

Add your QR code to the virtual background during meetings
During remote meetings, you can use your digital business card’s QR code to create a virtual background.

Attendees get your digital business card when they scan the QR code.

What should I put on my business card?
Contact information
This is a vital portion of your business card. Because people can’t reach you if there’s no contact information.

Your contact information includes your:

Name
Title and headline
Company name
Phone number
Email address
Website.
Address (virtual or physical)
Professional headshot (profile picture)
At first glance, your headshot tells if you’re someone to connect with or not. So, it’s important to use one that’s professional looking.

Brand assets
This includes your logo and color palette. Ensure the logo is legible and not pixelated.

Social media links
Include links to social media profiles. This way, people have multiple ways to connect with you.

Additional data
Include other relevant additional information such as skills, accreditations, meeting links, and payment links.

Our Excel templates for realtors are designed to do that. You’ll get helpful cues that remind you what to record, track, and analyze.

A spreadsheet’s rows and columns give you the structure to capture every detail about your clients, your properties, or your investments. Instead of leaving these details to memory, use a spreadsheet as the brain for your real estate business.

In this post, we’re sharing 7 Excel templates realtors are sure to benefit from! Whether you’re using a spreadsheet to track leads, calculate a profitable investment, or run a property, we’ve got you covered.

7 Customer Service Skills All Amazing Realtors Possess

7 Customer Service Skills All Amazing Realtors Possess
If you’re reading this, you’re probably a junior realtor. And that’s ok. The trail to a mountain’s peak starts at its bottom, and all masters started as students. So, here are the seven customer service skills amazing realtors possess.

My first experience with a realtor
First, a story from my own personal experience.

When I bought my first investment property in 2017, I was 26 years of age, I purposefully chose a small, family-owned team, because it was my very first professional interaction as a buyer, and needed a guiding hand—to not just help me with the paperwork—but educate me on things I’m yet to discover. My chosen agent and his team (his wife and one assistant) didn’t believe this B-class property was a good deal, but I insisted, having noticed some serious market trends. 

Long story short, I ended up buying a condominium next to UNLV (University of Las Vegas).

I knew the current tenant was paying $600 a month, that they were about to leave the apartment, and if I put about $4k into fixing and furnishing it, I could rent it for $200 more. My agent didn’t believe it’ll rent for $800. Guess what? It did.

For twelve months the property cash-flowed. Then, I wanted to sell. 

We found a buyer from California, and everything went smoothly. I bought it for $60k, and sold it for $89k. However, after the paperwork was signed, and money was in escrow, on the very last day of the process, Murphy's law hit me with a pipe leak. And my agent? He was on vacation and uncontactable.

His trusty assistant (who was genuinely superb) was also on vacation. There wasn’t anyone at the firm who could help me or reassure me and he hadn’t put a substitute agent in place. Being a newbie, I freaked out. Now that I’m a bit more experienced, and after the deal did go through, I know I overreacted, but ultimately, the agent could have provided better customer service. 

Here’s why.

7 Customer service skills amazing realtors have
1. Setting up an emergency line
Ok, it’s not a skill, but my story emphasizes this perfectly. The feeling of helplessness left a bitter taste in my mouth. It actually made me not want to work with him anymore. Everyone deserves a vacation, and deals happen year-long, but it was his responsibility to have at least one operating member on his team able to respond if/when emergencies (or urgent calls) happen. Don’t be that agent who leaves no one at the helm. Ever.

2. Communication
Clear communication is the backbone of every human interaction, especially in deal-making; and even more so when it involves an emotional purchase carrying a high-ticket price, like a house.

3. Setting expectations
Explain the process, timeline, and what’s required from you and your client for everything to go smoothly. If the commission from smaller deals like mine won’t appeal to you, refer to someone else. If you only specialize in selling homes to families, not condos for investors, say so. 

4. Balancing sales and service
Understand the difference between selling and helping. In a perfect scenario—and those happen—these two align. But sometimes, agents can cross the line, mistake the grey zone, and blur the boundaries. If it’s a win for you but not so much for the other sides (seller and/or buyer), then maybe this quick gain (think: fat check) isn’t worth tarnishing your brand over (long-term referrals and reputation). 

5. Be transparent
Even at the cost of losing a client. Be radically honest, and tell your client if you know the agent on the other side, how it affects the deal, how much fees and commission are involved, and why.

6. Be empathetic
To be empathetic, you’ll have to employ active listening and go beyond just hearing what is said. You’ll have to understand what is said, and why. Ryan Serhant once shared he was able to sell a mansion to a wealthy person just because he realized, after actively listening, that this home purchase is happening because he’s getting divorced, and as a father, he really cares about the new rooms of his two daughters. So Ryan focused his showings in this instance on homes with unique, spacious, and cozy kid rooms.

7. Be knowledgeable 
Being able to educate your clients and guide them throughout the process is key to providing best-in-class customer service. Paradoxically, this can eliminate future complaints—and complaints are what we think about when we say “customer service”. So, let’s call being knowledgeable “preventative customer service”.

Bonus: Know your audience
At the time, five years ago, I thought a realtor is a realtor, without being able to distinguish between different types of agents. I told my agent I am going to lease the property. But in hindsight, my realtor worked with home buyers, or mortgage to own, not mortgage to lease (I paid cash, but it’s the mindset and knowledge we’re talking about), and yet he onboarded me even though he didn’t specialize in what I needed.

Knowing who you serve is the foundation of providing them with quality customer service.

Now that you know to focus on communication, expectations, the difference between selling and helping, transparency, empathy, knowing your audience, and how important it is to set up an emergency line, you’re one step ahead of other agents!

15 Great Professional Headshot Examples (And Why They Work)


15 Great Professional Headshot Examples (And Why They Work)
In 2019, a San-Franscisco-based headshot studio commissioned a four months study to prove the importance of professional headshots. They asked 243 randomly selected people to rate the competence, likeability, and influence of 3 participants based only on their headshots. For comparison, they provided 1 professional headshot and 1 low-quality image of each participant. 

The result? Professional headshots led to a 76% increase in how competent each participant appeared. It also increased their likeability and influence by 9% and 62%, respectively. 

What does this tell you?

It tells me that in this era of on-screen first impressions, the professional imagery you put forward influences people’s perceptions of you. And in a big way.

Whether you’re getting ready to land your next job or  to network with other professionals, a professional headshot presents you in the best light and makes others take you seriously.

So, today, I’ll show you 15 great professional headshot examples to inspire your next headshot shoot. I’ve sourced these headshots from across the web from a range of different industries. I’ve also rounded up expert tips (from pro photographers) for getting the best professional headshots.

But first —

What Makes A Great Headshot?
A confident, competent, and organized look that tells people who come across your online profile or digital business card that you know your stuff. 

Because a headshot is to your personal brand what a logo is to a company, Dan Lewis, pro photographer at Badassity Brand Photography, says its job is to represent your unique personality, style, and energy.

He says a great headshot should be a mix of

authority
empathy and
approachability. 
At first glance, a person should be able to form an impression of who you are and decide whether you’re worth connecting with. This means your pose, outfit, and backdrop should be consistent with your personal brand and resonate with the people you’re connecting with. 

Now that you know what a great headshot should look like, here are some headshot examples from different professions to inspire your headshot shoot.

I’d say professional, trustworthy, and kind, given the nature of their job. And that’s exactly how Damian’s LinkedIn headshot looks. 

Whether you’re a male or female real estate agent, a formal business look helps define the kind of business you run. To that, a nice jacket, dress shirt, a tie (if male), and warm smile send just the right message — I’m the professional you can trust.

Even though Damian’s outfit gives his headshot a serious formal look, his warm smile and soft gaze make him look very approachable. Just from this headshot, you’d agree he’s the kind of realtor anyone would choose to work with.

2. A Freelance Writer's Headshot With a Compelling Look

Freelance content writer Orgesa gets so many things right with her headshot. First, the plain background works well with her hair, outfit, and brand colors to keep the attention on her face. 

Then her subtle smile and focused gaze make her appear compelling and likable. And if you’re a writer, that’s the kind of perception you’d want potential clients and industry peers to have when they come across your profile. 

3. A Creative Headshot Example for A Graphic Designer

Source: Twitter
What I love about Maggie’s headshot is the creativity and thought she put into it. 

From her pose to the grayscale theme, you can tell she understands the importance of showing off her personality while maintaining a tasteful look.

The days of wearing only formal outfits for professional headshots are long gone, especially if you work in a creative industry.

Now, when you network with professionals online, they want to see and connect with the personality behind your brand. So, if you’re a creative, capture it in your headshot. Let people get a hint of who you are by looking at the image on your profile.

4. A Sporting Director Headshot With a Smart, Impressive Look

Source: Twitter
I love how Chris’s formal outfit and studio setting give his headshot a professional look consistent with his industry. However, his big smile and happy eyes convey a relaxed, friendly personality which is great for creating an instant connection with people.

5. A Solopreneur With a Self-Assured Headshot

Source: Twitter
If you plan to become a successful solopreneur, then you understand that you’re the brand and the business. Therefore, you must look the part at all times, beginning with your headshot. 

Justin Welsh’s Twitter headshot gets it right. 

As someone who works primarily with early-stage startups and entrepreneurs, the dark background, stern look, and glint in his eyes send a powerful message—I’m confident, resilient, and professional.

One look at his headshot, and you’d think he's a serious businessman. And for someone whose business is building an audience and connecting with other professionals online, that’s a great first impression.

6. A Photographer’s Headshot With a Cheerful, Welcoming Vibe

Source: LinkedIn
For photographers, the feelings your headshot evokes give people a hint of what to expect should they decide to shoot with you. 

Glynns’ headshot exudes a calm, friendly feeling, which can build trust with potential clients. Her wide smile invites you to relax while she helps you create the professional portraits you desire.

From the way she holds her camera up, you can tell she’s a photographer before you read her headline. Including an object or backdrop that shows your business or brand is always a great idea as long as it’s not distracting.

💡Pro Tip → If you’re a photographer, learn more about Blinq, the digital business cards photographers love.

7. An Architect’s Headshot With a Look of Competence

Source: Twitter
One thing Marica’s headshot gets right is it relates to the field she works in. Her jacket, hairstyle, and facial expression exude competence, the core quality expected of architects. The environmental background acts as a prop and adds context to her photo.

Even though she works in a professional field, her casual pose and genuine smile give off a cool, approachable vibe. 

8. A Non-Profit Worker With an Environmental Style Headshot

Source: LinkedIn
The non-profit sector is often less formal than its corporate counterpart. So, a lovely outdoor headshot like Caroline’s is a great idea if you’re a charity or social worker.

Caroline’s wide smile gives her headshot a kind, authentic outlook. Her direct gaze is great for creating an emotional connection with the viewer. The natural background also brings a calm feeling that’s in line with her industry. 

9. A Marketing Director’s Headshot With a Professional, Confident Look

Source: LinkedIn
People who work in marketing know that faces are a powerful part of personal branding. 

A great headshot on your social profiles makes you look competent and builds a sense of trust with prospective clients and industry peers. 

Take Adam’s headshot as an example. His sharp formal outfit and business-inspired silhouette are relatable to other professionals in his field. 

His calm facial expression also sends a powerful message—I’m the guy you can trust to deliver successful outcomes for your business.

10. An Event Manager’s Headshot With a Nice Casual Look

For someone who works in the hospitality industry, Katherine's LinkedIn headshot does a great job of balancing business with casual. 

Her nice outfit, charming smile, and backdrop align with her lifestyle brand.

11. A Captivating Chef Headshot

Source: Twitter
I’d say Takashi's headshot is everything a chef's headshot should be—illustrative and professional. 

Though taken indoors, the natural light combines with his outfit and relaxed pose to give his headshot a captivating look. 

As a chef, your headshot should reflect your style and personality as much as your food does. 

So if the classic chef pose isn't your mojo, feel free to try something less traditional like smiling, laughing, or garnishing a dish.

12. A Vibrant Social Media Manager Headshot

Source: LinkedIn
What I love the most about Kassandra’s LinkedIn headshot is the overall play of colors. The solid background, green outfit, and dark hair work together to make her face and expression sparkle.

Considering the saturated industry she works in, a headshot like this helps her stand out. 

At first glance, she checks a lot of boxes. Creative. Great personality. Approachable. These are traits business owners look for when hiring social media managers. So, make sure the headshot you put forward represents you accordingly!

13. A Psychologist's Headshot With a Friendly Look

Source: LinkedIn
For psychologists, it's important to balance professionalism with personality. If you’re meeting clients on social media, your headshot should communicate who you are and give them a hint of what it’s like to sit with you.

Take Jennifer's LinkedIn headshot as an example. She looks happy, friendly, and inviting—an awesome first impression for a psychologist and a great way to build trust with new clients.

The soft lighting combines with her smile and natural look to give the impression that she’s a kind and gentle person. It looks like she’s saying:, “l see you, you can speak to me, I want to listen.”

14. A Journalist's Headshot With a Calm, Collected Look

Source: LinkedIn
Part of being a journalist is approaching people you don’t know to ask for interviews. As such, a friendly and professional headshot goes a long way in determining whether they’ll decide to speak to you.

Take a look at Beth’s headshot.

It looks professional but is also inviting and approachable. 

The studio lighting, plain background, and warm colors keep the viewer's attention on her face. Her slightly forward posture, appearance, and facial expression all feel soft and calming.

15. An Author’s Headshot With a Relaxed, Fun Vibe

Source: LinkedIn
If you’re an author, then understand that an impressive headshot is not only essential for your personal brand. It also gets people interested in reading your book. 

Look at Roger Neilsen’s LinkedIn headshot. It’s

neat
looks intelligent and 
interesting.
The bright lighting and plain studio background keep the focus on his face. And though his outfit is business-like, his pose and facial expression suggest a fun and welcoming personality. It wouldn’t be out of place to assume his book will match his image. 

Now, as you use the above examples as inspiration, keep the following tips from professional photographers in mind.

Top 4 easy ways to make your headshot look professional
1. Make Sure You Use Great Lighting
Whether it’s natural or artificial studio lighting, good lighting is key to getting a great professional headshot, says Paul Smith, headshot photographer at Paul David Smith Photography. He recommends taking some shots in both a studio and a natural setting.


Paul David Smith
“Professional photographers have studio flashes they can control. But if taking shots indoors using natural light, then ensure you have the photo taken near the window, so lots of light falls on your face. If outdoors, try to avoid direct sunlight as they make you backlit”.
2. Dress Properly and Comfortably

Darren Irwin, Headshot Photographer at Newcastle Headshots.
"You should dress in a way that represents your personal brand, specifically how your colleagues and clients would expect to see you.”
According to professional head photographer Richard Waine, your headshot won’t look great if you’re not comfortable in your outfit. Therefore, he recommends using the clothes you love as they help boost your confidence in front of the camera. However, they shouldn’t be overly busy or distracting.

3. Avoid Cluttered or Distracting Backgrounds
Cluttered or distracting backgrounds with bold patterns and logos detract from your image and take the focus away from you. You should also make sure the backgrounds you choose, whether indoor or outdoor, work well with your choice of outfit.

4. Be Yourself
The best professional headshot looks natural and brings out your best features. So, Paul David Smith recommends not overthinking or overdoing your facial expression.

What is The Best Color to Wear For a Professional Headshot?
When it comes to colors, both dark and light colors can work well. However, dark, solid colors do a better job of highlighting your features, says Chris Cottrell, headshot photographer at Cottrell Photographers.

What Outfit Should a Woman Wear For a Professional Headshot? 
Headshot and commercial photographer, Glynns Thomas suggests using simple well-fitted clothing that keeps the focus on your face instead of your outfit. For instance, v-necks and button-down shirts can give you a lovely neck length, while flowy, loose-fitting clothes make you look bigger on camera.

How to Prepare For Your Professional Headshot
Choose a photographer who specializes in headshot photography: Heike Martin, a headshot and branding photographer recommends choosing a headshot photographer you connect with on a personal level. According to her, such a photographer will communicate in a transparent and friendly manner. They’ll also help you relax, prepare for the shoot, and have an amazing experience, which will impact the quality of the images you get.
Pick your outfits early, then press them to ensure they’re free from wrinkles, pet hair, and lint (studio light can pick those up).
Get some rest before your shoot so you can relax better in front of the camera.
Prepare to spend a decent amount of time in there because rushing can affect the quality of your headshots. 
Go into your headshot ready to have some fun and a few laughs.

Digital Transformation in Real Estate: How to Adapt in 2023

Digital Transformation in Real Estate: How to Adapt in 2023
Digital transformation in real estate started about a decade ago, with the PropTech (property technology) sector raising $250 million in venture capital. But in 2022, PropTech reached mesmerizing heights, as VC poured $13.1 billion into the industry, causing it to outperform the global venture capital market. In 2023, in order to adapt to these digital transformations in real estate, pay attention to these trends.

Digital journeys 
43% of US homebuyers are millennials, and 63% of clients are more likely to return to websites providing virtual chat support. Combining these two stats with common sense proves younger buyers, as they naturally grow older and seek a home, will become your target audience, and that because they grew up in a digitally interconnected, agile environment — their expectations of a digital journey will no longer just be expectations — but requirements. 

Millennials will avoid bureaucracy and flee to brokerages and agents who digitally adapted to reduce clunky processes and slow paperwork for smoother digital journeys.

But what is a digital journey? 

Well, everything that your client needs to go through in the buying/selling process, from start to finish — with a focus on the parts that can be made faster and more efficient — regardless of physical location. Yep — it goes beyond digital signatures. Think of:

Offers
Quotes
Real-time transaction tracking
Loan applications and processing
Document management and file sharing
Scheduling and following up on appointments
And even the property showing itself. Now digital property showings go beyond pictures and video. Online 2D showings aren’t enough anymore, and startups like Giraffe 360 and Matterport are making 3D property showings common.

VR/AR (virtual/augmented reality)
Let’s elaborate on that last point and talk about virtual and augmented reality. First, let’s clarify: AR uses a real-world setting while VR is completely virtual.

In 2020, when I consulted Matterport before they went public via SPAC for $3.5 billion, I wrote for Wealth Magazine (BiggerPockets) on how AR/VR is here to stay, and how the pandemic was just a catalyst for an already gushing trend.

And indeed, in 2021, Redfin revealed that in June 2020, 45% of home purchases were made through remote digital tours, and in December 2020, it jumped to a staggering 63%. 

Back then, it was a necessity, as flights were not an option due to an ongoing pandemic.  But today, the world has gone back to normal — a new normal — because those times of need changed the barometer of what digital tools mean for comfort, accessibility, and necessity.

Now, buyers not only know this tech exists — they expect it — as it makes buying houses in different states, countries, and even continents easier. Even if flying to a home viewing is a possibility, why do so if you can do it from your couch? Don’t just think of wealthy people buying extra homes. Think of the family relocating due to one of the parents’ job change. This family is now able to find their new home after two days of couch-sitting and iPad scrolling.

And as time passes, awareness of these technologies will increase across different age groups, and as your consumer base naturally becomes older in age but younger in tech adoption, they will have become accustomed to these trends — seeing their friends (and even parents) buy a home this way. Then, as more people get used to such advancements, they will become a requirement for them.

This can all sound intimidating, but it’s also a blessing. Suddenly, showings are not restricted by physical presence, you’re not limited by your zip code, and your buyers can come from everywhere.

Chatbots
Remember how 63% of people browsing the web are more likely to come back to websites with virtual chat support? Setting up such a system is crucial for a digital transformation. It’ll enable your brokerage to segment your audience based on their needs and questions, and save on labor costs — helping with basic customer support inquiries.

But that’s not new — the sector has been doing that for quite some time now. In 2023, with advancements in tech, some smarter chatbots like Tidio can assist your customers with more aspects of the real estate business, like finding the right property and helping with financial transactions.

However, this is a double-edged sword. If you become this brokerage that’s perceived as robotic — because of its messaging, or because getting to a human is a chore — it’ll backfire. For this to work, you need to have the right balance of human/chat interaction, create ultra-personalized chatbot responses; for the UX/UI and copy to be superb; flow well; and feel human-like.

‍

A final thought on digital transformation
‍

Now you know more about what digital transformations to pay attention to in 2023, focusing on digital journeys, VR/AR showings, and smart chatbots. And of course, realtors who brand themselves like to share their Blinq digital business card on LinkedIn. These digital cards let your LinkedIn followers save your contact details with a click, so you’ll be on speed dial when they need to sell their home!

7 Customer Service Skills All Amazing Realtors Possess

7 Customer Service Skills All Amazing Realtors Possess

7 Customer Service Skills All Amazing Realtors Possess
If you’re reading this, you’re probably a junior realtor. And that’s ok. The trail to a mountain’s peak starts at its bottom, and all masters started as students. So, here are the seven customer service skills amazing realtors possess.

My first experience with a realtor
First, a story from my own personal experience.

When I bought my first investment property in 2017, I was 26 years of age, I purposefully chose a small, family-owned team, because it was my very first professional interaction as a buyer, and needed a guiding hand—to not just help me with the paperwork—but educate me on things I’m yet to discover. My chosen agent and his team (his wife and one assistant) didn’t believe this B-class property was a good deal, but I insisted, having noticed some serious market trends. 

Long story short, I ended up buying a condominium next to UNLV (University of Las Vegas).

I knew the current tenant was paying $600 a month, that they were about to leave the apartment, and if I put about $4k into fixing and furnishing it, I could rent it for $200 more. My agent didn’t believe it’ll rent for $800. Guess what? It did.

For twelve months the property cash-flowed. Then, I wanted to sell. 

We found a buyer from California, and everything went smoothly. I bought it for $60k, and sold it for $89k. However, after the paperwork was signed, and money was in escrow, on the very last day of the process, Murphy's law hit me with a pipe leak. And my agent? He was on vacation and uncontactable.

His trusty assistant (who was genuinely superb) was also on vacation. There wasn’t anyone at the firm who could help me or reassure me and he hadn’t put a substitute agent in place. Being a newbie, I freaked out. Now that I’m a bit more experienced, and after the deal did go through, I know I overreacted, but ultimately, the agent could have provided better customer service. 

Here’s why.

7 Customer service skills amazing realtors have
1. Setting up an emergency line
Ok, it’s not a skill, but my story emphasizes this perfectly. The feeling of helplessness left a bitter taste in my mouth. It actually made me not want to work with him anymore. Everyone deserves a vacation, and deals happen year-long, but it was his responsibility to have at least one operating member on his team able to respond if/when emergencies (or urgent calls) happen. Don’t be that agent who leaves no one at the helm. Ever.

2. Communication
Clear communication is the backbone of every human interaction, especially in deal-making; and even more so when it involves an emotional purchase carrying a high-ticket price, like a house.

3. Setting expectations
Explain the process, timeline, and what’s required from you and your client for everything to go smoothly. If the commission from smaller deals like mine won’t appeal to you, refer to someone else. If you only specialize in selling homes to families, not condos for investors, say so. 

4. Balancing sales and service
Understand the difference between selling and helping. In a perfect scenario—and those happen—these two align. But sometimes, agents can cross the line, mistake the grey zone, and blur the boundaries. If it’s a win for you but not so much for the other sides (seller and/or buyer), then maybe this quick gain (think: fat check) isn’t worth tarnishing your brand over (long-term referrals and reputation). 

5. Be transparent
Even at the cost of losing a client. Be radically honest, and tell your client if you know the agent on the other side, how it affects the deal, how much fees and commission are involved, and why.

6. Be empathetic
To be empathetic, you’ll have to employ active listening and go beyond just hearing what is said. You’ll have to understand what is said, and why. Ryan Serhant once shared he was able to sell a mansion to a wealthy person just because he realized, after actively listening, that this home purchase is happening because he’s getting divorced, and as a father, he really cares about the new rooms of his two daughters. So Ryan focused his showings in this instance on homes with unique, spacious, and cozy kid rooms.

7. Be knowledgeable 
Being able to educate your clients and guide them throughout the process is key to providing best-in-class customer service. Paradoxically, this can eliminate future complaints—and complaints are what we think about when we say “customer service”. So, let’s call being knowledgeable “preventative customer service”.

Bonus: Know your audience
At the time, five years ago, I thought a realtor is a realtor, without being able to distinguish between different types of agents. I told my agent I am going to lease the property. But in hindsight, my realtor worked with home buyers, or mortgage to own, not mortgage to lease (I paid cash, but it’s the mindset and knowledge we’re talking about), and yet he onboarded me even though he didn’t specialize in what I needed.

Knowing who you serve is the foundation of providing them with quality customer service.

Now that you know to focus on communication, expectations, the difference between selling and helping, transparency, empathy, knowing your audience, and how important it is to set up an emergency line, you’re one step ahead of other agents!

6 Things You NEED to Know About QR Code Security

6 Things You NEED to Know About QR Code Security
QR codes–we’ve all seen them in store windows, at check-outs, on advertisements. 

‍


Free to use image from Pexels
Once upon a time, they were used by manufacturers to catalog inventory. Now, they’re everywhere, used by businesses, governments, marketers, and individuals alike. 

‍

In today’s world of encroaching technology, QR codes are a bridge between physical and digital space. A QR code acts like a middleman between a physical touchpoint and a digital world, like an auto attendant from Dialpad UK.

What are QR codes and how do they work?
QR stands for Quick Response. QR codes were developed as a successor to bar codes and as such, they can store more information and be processed faster than their predecessors. They represent the next generation of technology, in the same way that business VoIP solutions are a modern replacement for outdated landline technology.

‍

QR codes consist of arrangements of black and white squares that contain encoded data. A smartphone can use a specialised app or its native camera to scan a QR code, parsing the encoded data into a link.

‍

Since their inception, the adoption of QR codes has looked promising, but the COVID-19 pandemic really spurred the need for a contactless system that provided both utility and safety. The spread of QR codes has only grown since then, with new use cases being discovered all the time. 

Why worry about QR code safety?
With mass adoption of new technology come mass security concerns, especially when that technology has become ingrained with words like “tracing”.

‍

One of the major concerns with QR codes is cybersecurity, as they can potentially provide a pathway for hackers to access sensitive information.

‍

Many of us are concerned with how businesses use our data.  


Image sourced from softwareadvice.co.uk
As QR codes have gotten more popular, scammers and hackers have gained more opportunities to scam and hack. As the technology becomes more creative, more useful, and more ingrained in our world, malicious actors have upped their game on new and creative use cases of their own. 

6 things you need to know about QR code security
1. The uses for QR codes are vast
The most important thing to know about QR codes is how far-reaching they are. You might not realise just how many uses QR codes have in our day-to-day lives.

COVID-19 precautions
Governments and businesses alike collaborated to limit the spread of COVID-19. Using massive databases managed by technology like API SAP, COVID-19 testing and contact tracing could be utilised on a massive scale. 

‍

Those databases needed a touchpoint, which is where QR codes really got to shine. 

‍

Whenever possible, people were asked to scan QR codes at restaurants, coffee shops, and healthcare establishments. That data was logged, and if an outbreak of COVID-19 happened at a location, that person could be informed and asked to self-isolate. 

Business cards
Adding QR codes to your printed business cards gives potential clients a quick and easy way to get to know you better. You can link the QR code to a landing page, social media account, video, or your email to facilitate engagement.

‍

You can also eliminate the need for physical business cards entirely by using digital QR code business cards. These allow potential clients to scan the QR code on your smart device instead, which cuts down on environmental waste. 

Tickets
Tickets for concerts, sporting events, and travel can use QR codes to enhance security and lower queuing times. 

‍

A QR code ticket can be quickly scanned and verified as legitimate, avoiding the hassle of someone having to check each and every ticket against a person’s details. This avoids human error, as well as deterring forgeries. 

‍

Since they can be delivered straight to your device, QR codes can also be entirely digital, cutting down on environmental waste.

Booking 
Establishments such as restaurants, hotels, and even healthcare services can use QR codes to facilitate bookings.

‍

Displaying a QR code in a window or on an advertisement offers customers a quick and easy way to make reservations. Instead of having to find a phone number, call a place, and speak to someone, customers can scan the QR code and be taken straight to that business’ booking page. 

‍

And like digital tickets, QR codes can also be used by businesses to verify those reservations.

Scan to pay
New technology strives to make our lives easier, and how we pay for things is a prime example of that.  

‍

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, many stores used QR codes to facilitate payment. Since the pandemic, that process has only gotten more efficient and widespread. Businesses can display QR codes that take customers to secure payment pages to make their purchases–including food and drink establishments, car parks, petrol stations, toll booths, and many more. 

‍

Payment companies like PayPal even allow you to scan QR codes from within their app, offering instant payment. 

Marketing
Adding a QR code to your advertising campaign is a great way to get people engaged with your content. Seeing a QR code on a poster or in a digital ad encourages people to scan, and you can link them to your website, app, social media account, or video content. 

2. QR codes are not intrusive
Now that we understand how significant QR codes can be, it’s important to understand what they are not.

‍

In a world where data collection is so pervasive, many of us worry about our privacy. And then COVID-19 precautions only emphasised the question: is the technology we’re relying on putting us in danger?

‍

Good news! Scanning a QR code does not allow it to steal your data, track your movements, or gain access to your device. The only data QR codes can log themselves is the location of the scan, how many times a QR code has been scanned, and the type of device doing the scanning. 

‍

QR codes are one-way delivery systems that give a device a simple instruction like “go to this webpage” or “open this app”. 

‍

What you do with that instruction is where things can get risky.

3. QR codes take you there–but the rest is on you
QR codes themselves are a data delivery system and cannot take anything from you. A QR code can only lead you to a digital location–a website, a social media channel, an email address, an app store page.

‍

A QR code at a restaurant might take you to a secure payment page, but you need to input your bank details. A QR code on a poster can take you to an app store page, but you need to click “download” to allow that app access to your device. 

‍

It’s important to guard your safety whenever you scan a QR code. Only scan at trusted locations, only download apps you can verify as safe, and don’t input personal details if you’re wary.

4. QR codes can be tampered with
QR codes tend to exist in public places and as such, scammers can easily tamper with them.

‍

The QR code itself cannot be changed, but scammers can create their own QR codes with their own malicious purposes and stick them over existing ones. 

‍

Before you scan a QR code, take a good look at it. If it seems off in any way, don’t use it. 

5. QR codes can contain malicious links
A QR code that has been tampered with, or a QR code in a non-secure environment, can lead to malicious websites or apps. 

‍

For example: you just had a nice meal at your favourite restaurant. Instead of going up to the bar to pay, you choose to scan the QR code that’s printed on your table. It takes you to the business’ secure payment page, you put in your card details, and the transaction completes.

‍

Except some shady character has stuck their own QR code over the restaurant’s. The secure payment page you thought you were accessing is actually a scam page, and you just typed your bank details into it.

‍

Always check any link a QR code is trying to open. If it’s a website, check that site’s security, and never let websites download anything to your device. If it’s an app, has that app been verified by an app store? 

6. Most of the scams involving QR codes use social engineering
The most common way scammers steal is by phishing–putting social pressure on people to willingly give up their personal details.

‍

Phishing is usually done through spam emails, texts, or phone calls. A scammer will reach out to you and either frighten or coerce you into giving them your banking details, answers to password hints, or login credentials.

 

QR code phishing (referred to as quishing) simply cuts out the middleman and takes you straight to the scam. To use the restaurant example again, a malicious QR code can take you to a fake payment page and steal your banking details because you’re already primed to give them up in that scenario. 

‍

We expect stores to have their own apps. If you’re in a store and a QR code claims to take you to that store’s official app, you’re expecting the app to be legitimate; but if a scammer has replaced the legitimate QR code with a malicious one, the app you download could be dangerous. 

‍

QR code scams are like any scam in this regard, and require you to be vigilant about the way you share your data. Never give up personal details to a source you cannot verify. 

To sum up…
QR codes have a place in our lives. They come with exciting new uses and offer utility, bolster security, streamline arduous tasks, and can even keep us safe. 

‍

But, as with any technology, QR codes come with risks. Making your life easier isn’t worth losing your life savings, after all. 

‍

Understanding how QR codes work and keeping a few safety precautions in mind will help you get the best out of QR codes whilst avoiding their pitfalls.

Fast-growing startup Blinq raises $5m to build simple, shareable identities for anyone, anywhere
Blackbird and Square Peg co-invest as Blinq marks rapid growth in users and businesses

MELBOURNE, 17 MAY 2022 — Blinq, a rapidly-growing startup based in Melbourne, has raised AUD$5 million from notable investors Blackbird and Square Peg Capital to revolutionise how professionals share their details and manage ongoing relationships.

“Blinq is one of the fastest-growing platforms we’ve seen in recent years. Just as Twitter and Airbnb took off at events such as South by Southwest, it’s exciting to see Blinq do the same this year,” said Rick Baker, Partner at Blackbird. “The last time Square Peg and Blackbird co-invested in a seed-stage startup, the result was Canva. With many social networks leading to fragmentation of identity, Blinq is creating a way to help people manage, control and share their identities in one place. We see such an exciting opportunity with what Blinq is building.”

Blinq lets you share a snapshot of your professional identity, make great first impressions and manage your ongoing relationships. Blinq replaces business cards and static contact apps with a live profile that can be shared with anyone via QR code, NFC card, short link, email signature or even video call background. With Blinq, you can quickly create multiple profiles to control which information you share, and with whom. Any information you share can be kept up to date so there is no need to inform your contacts when you change numbers, emails or other information.

Early Uber Eats operator and software engineer Jarrod Webb developed Blinq in 2017, observing frustration with paper business cards and the lack of a truly transformative digital option for exchanging contact details. What started as a hobby grew into a substantial opportunity last year as QR code adoption unlocked a reliable way for professionals to quickly share their identity with anyone. In January 2021, Webb left Uber Eats to catch this tailwind and accelerate growth in users and businesses in the post-COVID era. 

“The paper business card has been outdated for decades, but we have never had something that could truly replace it. With QR codes becoming more commonplace during the pandemic, it’s now easier than ever to quickly share your information, manage it from anywhere and keep it up to date,” Webb said. 

Blinq integrates with CRM platforms and directories like Salesforce, HubSpot and Azure AD to provide companies with a single source of truth on contact information, and rich context to help keep their pipeline information up to date and ready for follow-ups.

“The first interaction is the bedrock of a business relationship and with it brings future opportunities. People are using Blinq to enhance that moment of connection,” Webb said.

James Tynan, Principal at Square Peg, said: "The contacts app is essentially the same as it was before the advent of the iPhone. It's time for a connected identity layer that never goes out of date, and we're excited to work with a founder like Jarrod who has the vision and ability to make that future happen."

With the new funding from Blackbird and Square Peg, Blinq is expanding the product team to create new features that help people connect and build successful professional relationships.

About Blinq

Blinq makes it easy for anyone to share their professional identity instantly online or in person, via a digital business card, email signature or video call background. With Blinq, you can quickly create multiple profiles to control which information you share, and with whom. Any information you share can be kept up to date so there is no need to inform your contacts when you change numbers, emails or other information.

Blinq is based in Australia and backed by notable investors Blackbird Ventures and Square Peg Capital.

Frequently asked questions about NFC business cards
How long does it take for a card to arrive?

Once your design has been reviewed, confirmed and approved, we send this off to print. It will take roughly 5-8 business days for our team to print it, encode it and ship it to your door.

Does Blinq require a paid subscription?

No, you can get Blinq NFC Cards without paying for a subscription. However, a lot of our customers choose to upgrade to a premium subscription to access more digital business cards and a range of features like having their logo in their QR code.

Does the person I’m sharing my card with also need to have the Blinq app?

No, the other person doesn’t need to have the app downloaded.

How do I design a custom card?

After you have purchased your custom Blinq card we will send you card template files in SVG and PNG. You can then import these templates into design software such as Photoshop, Illustrator or Canva and add your custom design. Cards will arrive 5-8 business days after your custom design is confirmed. We've written guides on designing cards in Photoshop and designing cards in Illustrator.

Or if you are a Blinq Business or Blinq Premium customer, you are able to request design help from our internal design team. We normally have 2 rounds of revision to help ensure you are happy with your cards before we send them to print!

How do you manufacture Blinq NFC cards?

We print Blinq NFC cards onto an elegant plastic canvas using high quality UV laser printers for a slick finish. We then encode the cards with the information you supply us from your Blinq Profile.

Do you produce metal cards?

We don’t currently do metal cards. We found that metal cards sometimes scratched phone screen when they were tapped against them.

Is the Blinq NFC card compatible with iPhones?

Blinq NFC business cards work with all models of iPhone from iPhone 11 and up. All of these phones have the compatible NFC chip installed. This can be located on the back of the phone near the front and back camera. The card also comes with a QR code in case the NFC doesn’t work.

Is the Blinq NFC card compatible with Android phones?

Blinq NFC business cards are compatible with all Android phone models which support Google Pay. Simply tap the NFC card against the back of the phone in the center. Blinq NFC Cards also have QR codes which your contact can scan if their NFC isn’t working.

Do you offer discounts for teams ordering multiple NFC business cards?

If you’re ordering more than 10 cards, we apply discount bulk pricing. For more information and to organize this, please get in touch with the team by filling out this form.

Can I send you the designs of our previous business cards?

Yes! If you provide the .pdf, .png or .jpg design files for your previous business cards, our design team will be able to layer this over our card templates to create a card for you. Simply fill out this form to get in touch with our designers!

What industries is the Blinq NFC Card best for?

The Blinq NFC Card isn’t limited to any particular industry - anyone who shares their contact details could benefit from our cards. However, we have seen significant popularity among realtors, freelancers, small business owners, not-for-profit fundraisers and sales professionals.

What happens if I try to share to a phone that doesn’t have NFC?

Some older phone models don’t have NFC enabled. That’s why we put a QR code on Blinq Essential cards and Blinq Infinite cards. We also provide you with a QR code to put on your Blinq Custom NFC Card should you choose to use it.

Can I get a QR code on my card?

Our Essential and Infinite NFC cards come with a QR Code printed on them. We also supply you with your own QR code if you’d like to include it on your custom card.

What does NFC stand for?

NFC stands for “near field communication”: it’s the name for the technology that underpins how our cards work.

The digital business card that’s always by my side
Gone are the days where I used to provide a business card to a client who then lost it and never called me again. Since using blinq the amount of callbacks I’ve gotten from clients has at least doubled. Customer service has also been fantastic as they helped me set up an enterprise account for my entire business and employees!

Frequently asked questions
Are Blinq cards secure?

Each card is given its own unique obfuscated link which cannot be accessed unless someone knows the link, i.e. they receive the card.
‍
All Blinq data is protected by Google Cloud.

Can I create multiple cards for a user?

Yes, you can create different cards ready for different situations. For example, in an internal team meeting where social media links could be shared vs. in a conference setting where only key professional details might be shared. Often, Blinq users create a card with their phone number and another card without their phone number, so they can share the right card for the right situation!
‍
Users can quickly swipe to different cards and share with a recipient depending on the context of the meeting.

How do I upgrade my free Blinq profile to Business?

Go to the Blinq dashboard on a desktop and select Blinq Business to get set up.

What is your privacy policy?

You can view our policy here.

We do not sell your data. We make revenue from subscriptions and sales of NFC accessory products.

Our Privacy Principles
At the core of Blinq's product is the enablement of sharing your information with those you want to share with. As a result, data privacy is critical to the product we offer. At Blinq, we believe in the importance of being able to control who gets that information.

To reflect this importance we've designed our product with made several principles in mind that are intended to protect your data and privacy:

Your data is yours
We don't sell or provide your data to third parties without your consent. It's just not what we do here at Blinq. Your data is yours to share with your network.

Secure Storage
Your data is protected by Enterprise grade encryption and security.

Safe Sharing
Every Blinq Card has a unique code and web address. Those you share your information with will be able to look at your details. If they share your card with others or their company, others may be able to view your details.‍

Introduction
This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you may provide in the "Blinq" mobile application ("Mobile Application" or "Service") and any of its related products and services (collectively, "Services") is collected, protected and used. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you ("User", "you" or "your") and Blinq Technologies Pty Ltd ("Blinq Technologies Pty Ltd", "we", "us" or "our", "Blinq"). Blinq is the company name of the operator of the Blinq Business Card Application ("Blinq"). By accessing and using the Software Applications and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
‍

Automatic collection of information
Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the no logs policy. We may process only minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the Software Applications and Services. Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding the usage of the Software Application and Services. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.

‍

Collection of personal information
You can access and use the Software Application and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the features in the Software Applications, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, make a purchase,  or fill any online forms in the Software Applications. When required, this information may include the following:

- Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.
- Contact information such as email address, address, etc.
- Account details such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc.
- Payment information such as credit card details, bank details, etc.
- Geolocation data such as latitude and longitude.
- Certain features on the mobile device such as contacts, calendar, gallery, etc.

Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Software Applications and Services. However, we may also collect Personal Information about you from other sources such as public databases, social media platforms, third-party data providers, and our joint marketing partners. Personal Information we collect from other sources may include demographic information, such as age and gender, device information, such as IP addresses, location, such as city and state, and online behavioral data, such as information about your use of social media websites, page view information and search results and links. You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features in the Software Applications. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.

‍

Use and processing of collected information
In order to make the Software Applications and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:

- Create and manage user accounts
- Deliver products or services
- Improve products and services
- Send administrative information
- Respond to inquiries and offer support
- Request user feedback
- Improve user experience
- Enforce terms and conditions and policies
- Protect from abuse and malicious users
- Respond to legal requests and prevent harm
- Run and operate the Software Applications and Services

Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Software Application and Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.

Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

‍

Billing and payments
We use third party payment processors to assist us in processing your payment information securely. Such third party processors' use of your Personal Information is governed by their respective privacy policies which may or may not contain privacy protections as protective as this Policy. We suggest that you review their respective privacy policies.

‍

Managing information
You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Mobile Application and Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below. If you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently delete your account, you can do so by contacting us.

‍

Disclosure of information
Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested, we may share your information with your consent with our trusted third parties that work with us, any other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Software Applications and Services available to you. We do not share Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties. These service providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We may share your Personal Information for these purposes only with third parties whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. These third parties are given Personal Information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes.

We will disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your user account, and Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred.

‍

Retention of information
We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.

‍

Transfer of information
Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this Policy or inquire with us using the information provided in the contact section.

Unless your Membership is suspended or terminated in accordance with these Terms, your Membership will roll over on an ongoing monthly or annual basis (based on your subscription), and you will be charged the same Fees on an ongoing monthly or annual basis from the Payment Date. Without limiting your rights under the Australian Consumer Law, you can cancel your Membership at any time in accordance with the “Cancellation of Memberships” clause of these Terms but the cancellation will only have effect from expiry of your monthly or annual subscription period for which you have paid the Fees.

7.3. The payment methods we offer for the Fees are set out on the Platform. We may offer payment through a third-party provider for example, Stripe. You acknowledge and agree that we have no control over the actions of the third-party provider, and your use of the third-party payment method may be subject to additional terms and conditions.

7.4. You must not pay, or attempt to pay, the Fees by fraudulent or unlawful means. If you make a payment by debit card or credit card, you warrant that you are authorised to use the debit card or credit card to make the payment.

If you vary your Membership and the Fees increase, the increased Fees will apply on the next Payment Date, pro-rated for the time between the date you vary your Membership, and the next Payment Date, and you will have access to the additional Membership features within 24 hours following your Membership change.

7.8. To the extent permitted by law, the Fees and Product Fees are non-refundable and non-cancellable once paid.

7.9. We may need to change what is available as part of your Membership (for example, the inclusions, exclusions, updated features) from time to time. If we remove any features or functionality, we will provide you with 30 days’ notice of the change. After 30 days, we will apply the changes to your Membership. If the changes substantially and adversely affect your enjoyment of the Membership, you may cancel your Membership in accordance with the ‘Cancellation of Memberships’ clause.

Linkedin for Realtors: What to share [with examples]

Linkedin for Realtors: What to share [with examples]
Social media is a powerful tool in the arsenal of any realtor. But what social media platform is the best? Is LinkedIn optimal for realtors? And what content to share? I answer these questions, show examples, and break down tips for content creation. Let’s dive in.

What is the best social media for Realtors?
If you asked me 18 months ago, I would’ve said LinkedIn and Facebook (who goes by Meta now). Today it’s definitely, LinkedIn, and maybe Meta.

So, what changed? 

Well, for starters, today iPhone users can block ad targeting. Android is said to follow. And given ad revenue is Meta’s main business model, evidenced by Zuckerberg’s famous smirk answer to a Senator, it ends up hurting the platform as a whole, as people get ads they hate, or which are irrelevant to them—making them abandon the platform.

Furthermore, because Zuckerberg and his team poured billions of dollars and tons of hours into this new identity revolving around AR/VR with products like the Quest Headset, Metaverse, and RayBan video Glasses, its older products (Facebook) suffer neglect amidst their identity crisis.

Yes, groups on Facebook are still powerful if you’re able to engage, comment, help, and give value for free as a group member, before you sell homes without building trust and rapport.

So, why has LinkedIn stayed on top for Realtors?

To be honest, I don’t know that it has. I’ve looked for properties recently in Bangkok, Thailand, and Tbilisi, Georgia—and Facebook was better when looking to rent. But when I looked for a reputable agent in order to network, learn, and buy a home, LinkedIn prevailed. Additionally:

LinkedIn is a much more organic platform, and Microsoft, LinkedIn’s owner, focuses on creators with new features like creator mode and “links in bio”. Furthermore, people genuinely show up on LinkedIn to either help (create content) or grow (learn from content). They reshare, engage, and comment more purposefully—and your feed mostly shows what your network shares and likes—rather than what some algorithm thought you’d prefer, like on Facebook. This has more oomph to it than it sounds—because trust is key in sales, and on LinkedIn.
‍

Secondly, and more importantly, it’s where your actual audience cohort. LinkedIn is a professional network, where people reading your content/ads are in the right headspace to buy a high-ticket product (think: house in the US with a median price of $420k). Additionally, in terms of demographics—LinkedIn is vastly superior. Its user's age, median income, and professional careers mean they’re much more likely to be in the market for a new house, relocating due to a job hop, or buying a new/second home, with the ability to afford it.
The catch? Quality comes with a price. 

How much does LinkedIn Premium cost?
LinkedIn premium’s cheapest tier starts at $30 a month. Sure, you can use LinkedIn for free, but as a professional agent, you’d like to have the ability to see data, analytics, and send InMails.

Examples of great posts by Realtors
Bill Gassett
Bill Gassett is a colleague and friend. Like me, he combines real estate and marketing. But unlike me, Bill attacks it from the other side—your side—the realtor’s side. 

Bill’s profile is a great example of a strong banner and profile picture. Banners are important and provide great real estate often neglected by users.


And here’s how he instills confidence and trust through multiple endorsements.


Lastly, here’s an example of a real post he shared, about a trending topic. A blog article he wrote (which’s part of his content strategy, leading from social to his blog).


Diana Kadan: sharing a client win
If you’ve had a big win, you can build client confidence and celebrate your achievement with a LinkedIn post. Diana’s post provides a great example of how you post about a purchase without having to name the clients.


Dustin Brohm: giving advice through videos
If done right, video can be an exceptionally compelling medium. Dustin Brohm posts videos on his LinkedIn to build trust and spread his influence, like this one about how to buy a house when you’re self-employed.


Frank Audano: local market data
Anyone can power up their laptop, check CNN and see reports on nationwide housing trends. But up-to-date local data? Well, that’s harder to come by. Frank Audano’s post makes his LinkedIn a source of local data for buyers in Kansas, sharing insights from a recent report.

What to share on LinkedIn
Now that we’ve seen some samples, what should you share on LinkedIn? 

Talk about your:

Success - to build authority. That big house sale. Your banking and escrow connections. Your articles, podcasts, and interviews. It all contributes to your personal brand.
Failures - to be authentic and humanize your content. Sharing defeats builds a different kind of connection. Stories like how that one time you lost that deal at the last minute because the buyer's bank didn’t approve his mortgage.
Personal experience - like how you know your area, master your zip code, and your specialty in Type A/B class properties, or relocating tech workers.
Your housing market knowledge - to show you’re intelligent, understand the bigger picture, and how the CRE, residential, and hospitality markets are connected. In times of doubt, fear, and uncertainty, talk about economical cycles, the prime rate, and inflation.
Also, lots of realtors like to share their Blinq digital business card on LinkedIn. These digital cards let your LinkedIn followers save your contact details with a click, so you’ll be on speed dial when they need to sell their home! Learn more about the digital business card realtors love.

Tips on creating content for Linkedin
You could share videos, but as you’ve seen on Bill’s post, he used a picture, because single-image-ads work best on LinkedIn. Unlike TikTok or Instagram, where video is more native, people react more positively to pictures on LinkedIn.

In terms of how to approach content creation, it’s best you use formulas of what works. Test and pivot according to your audience’s feedback. You can create Polls (a LinkedIn feature) and ask what topics they like most, and then prepare templates for yourself as I’ve done on Notion:


Now that you know what social media is best for realtors (depending on your offering), seen examples of the content shared there, and advice on how to do it yourself, you’re ready to create more impact as a realtor!

Top 8 Business Networking Tools to Supercharge Your Growth
What comes to your mind when you think about professional networking?

Handshakes, smiles, and events with other professionals will most likely be your answer. And you’d be correct—up to a point. 

While many people cringe at the prospect of attending a networking event, for others it’s their go-to approach to socialize with other professionals in their field.

But what if I told you, you could have your cake and eat it too? I’m talking about networking and meeting other professionals without leaving the comfort of your home. 

It’s all possible with the right business networking tool. 

But why’s networking so important? 

For starters, networking gives you access to the people and opportunities essential for your growth. It’s an avenue to connect with like-minded individuals in your field, brainstorm ideas and learn. And for professionals, networking is a game-changer—the key to their success. 

According to Zippia’s recent research, 79% of Americans say networking is crucial to their career progression. So it’s not uncommon to see many business professionals fast-track their careers just by having the right network.

However, despite the many benefits of networking, only 48% of people actually stay in touch with their network.

‍The question—Why does this happen?

If you’re like most people that find it hard to keep networking and making new connections, it’s mainly because of these two reasons:

You’re not using the right business networking tools
You’re approaching business networking the wrong way 
And that’s fine. Many people don’t know their way around professional networking. 

Thanks to the internet, professional networking has moved beyond in-person interactions. With online platforms and tools, you can easily connect with people, build relationships and get mentorship to grow your business.

In today’s guide, we’ll be covering top business networking tools along with five networking tips to help you make meaningful connections and build stronger professional relationships.

Top 8 Business Networking Tools
1. Blinq: Easily Share Your Professional Identity With Digital Business Cards

The first step in networking with people is exchanging your contact information. 

Blinq offers an easy way to create a memorable first impression and share your identity when networking online and in person. With Blinq, you can create a quick digital business card containing all your professional details and share it with a single tap.

Bling allows you to

Impress new contacts with QR code-powered business cards.
Personalize your business card.
Securely share your card with anyone, anyhow you like. You decide.

Automatically save personal information from digital business cards.

Promote your business on the go with customized company identity cards.
Manage customer details and keep contact information up to date.
If you’re connecting with people physically, they can get your information by scanning the QR code on your phone or apple watch without even having the Blinq app.

When networking online, simply email, text, copy the link to your business card or share it any other way you prefer directly from the Blinq app.

Additionally, Blinq automatically adds the contact information from any digital business card you receive to your phone. It also allows you to attach personal notes to each contact. For example, you can record where and when you met, the things you talked about, and when next you’re scheduled to speak or meet.

One great feature I love about Blinq is the extensive level of customization it gives.

Your card can contain any kind of professional information, from your company website address to social media details and even online payment links like PayPal and CashApp. 

You can also 

switch the Blinq brand colors to yours, 
customize your QR code, 
create an email signature, and 
add virtual backgrounds to share your card over video chat.
It’s simply amazing.

Take a look at my card below. See how I replaced the Blinq brand color with mine and added my Calendy meeting link. Now, clients can book a meeting with me without even visiting my website.


And that’s not even all. 

Blinq lets you create multiple profiles and cards so you can control the information you share and with whom when networking.

My favorite part about using the Blinq card to network is that it eliminates the need to inform my network about changes to my personal information. That’s because every profile you create on Blinq is live. So, the tool automatically keeps your details up to date.

If you’re a company, Blinq business makes it easy to manage your organization’s professional identity. With up-to-date digital business cards customized to your branding, your team can network and promote your company on the go.

Blinq also integrates with CRM platforms like Hubspot, Salesforce and Azure AD. This means you can effortlessly manage your contacts and keep customer information up to date and ready for follow-up, all from a single dashboard.

2. Hunter.io: Find Emails of People You Want to Network With

Whether you’re meeting people online or at physical networking events, sending an email is a surefire way to start a conversation, connect, and keep a relationship going. 

To find the email addresses of people you want to network with, use Hunter.io, a successful email-finding tool trusted by millions of professionals worldwide. 

Hunter helps you find emails of specific persons within organizations. For instance, as a freelance B2B content writer and marketer, I’m always looking to connect with and pitch my services to B2B companies. 

So, with Hunter, I effortlessly find email addresses of decision makers like content marketing leads, SEO managers and marketing managers within companies I desire to work with. From there, I pitch them, make enquiries or connect with them. 

And this works for every other kind of business. 

Use Hunter’s domain search tool to find all the email addresses associated with a specific company. Then, filter the result you get by department, type or even company data.

And if you know the particular person you want to connect with within an organization, then use the finder tool to fetch their email in seconds. But that’s not all the finder tool does. It also tells you if the email address you’re searching for is verified and where it was found.

Shows a screenshot of Hunter IO in use to find someone's email address. The tool has guessed an email address with 97% certainty.
Hunter has a chrome extension you can install on your browser to quickly find emails anywhere on the web when you visit a website. If you find email addresses elsewhere, quickly pop them into Hunter’s email verifier tool to confirm they’re correct and valid.

Andrew Gonzales, the Co-Founder and President at Business Loans, says his company has had great success using Hunter to find emails for networking with decision-makers and high-level executives from various companies.

“Hunter takes the guesswork out of cold communication and replaces it with valuable data to populate our CRM database,” he says.

3. Lunchclub: Make Professional Connections, Powered by AI

Away from in-person networking events, online platforms have proved very helpful for bringing people together to connect and build relationships. 

One such platform is Lunchclub, an AI super-connector that facilitates virtual calls between business professionals with similar interests.

Here’s how it works. 

Let’s say you’re a business owner or professional looking to grow your network. When you sign up for Lunclub for free and provide basic information about yourself, your goals and your interests, the AI platform will make personalized introductions and connect you with other professionals who match your interest.

"When I was actively growing my business network and looking to meet investors, I signed up for Lunchclub. I indicated that I was interested in speaking primarily with investors, and the platform would match me with investors looking to speak primarily with early-stage business owners. I met a number of business professionals with extremely impressive accomplishments, many of whom I'm still in contact with today.”

— Calloway Cook, President at Illuminate Labs.

Every day, the platform will recommend about 10 topics and people you could be interested in following and connecting with. They are called “daily picks.”

These recommendations are based on your goals and interests. If you’re interested in connecting, Lunchclub will introduce you. Then you can start chatting away and arranging calls with users. 

To turn the heat up, put meeting people on autopilot by blocking time on your calendar. Then, Lunchclub will automatically schedule meetings for you with new people that match your profile. Just don’t forget to check the box at the bottom left corner so it can match you with people in your area.

For a free platform, Lunchclub is more time efficient and effective for networking than meeting someone in person for coffee. 

Alex Birkett, co-founder at Ominiscient Digital, a content agency, says the connections he has made from Lunchclub have resulted in several interesting conversations, one of which became a client.

4. Slack: Communicate, Collaborate and Network in One Place

In recent years, Slack has evolved from an intra-company communication tool into a powerful networking platform. Professionals across different fields use private, invite-only slack communities to network, share job leads, and exchange career advice. 

For freelancers and other service providers, gaining access to your industry’s slack community can put you in front of hiring managers and potential clients. But that’s not all. Slack forums also present an opportunity for you to connect with industry peers, share knowledge, and learn from experts.

It, however, starts with finding the right community.

For instance, Superpath is one of the leading slack communities in the content marketing space. It’s a supportive group of marketers, SEOs, content managers, company founders and freelancers looking to network with potential clients and hires and learn from each other. 

With over 11,500 members, the Superpath community is like an insider club with a constant flow of collaboration opportunities, gigs and meaningful conversations. 

Take a look at the screenshots below.

A screenshot from a Slack community where a man called Sea n has put out. request for agency owners and project managers to share tips on managing multiple clients at scale.
A man called Jason advertising his content writing services in a Slack channel.
A screenshot of a man called Reueben asking if anyone has built a successful blog without using paid SEO Tools
By actively networking on slack communities, you can make connections that open career doors and take your business to the next level. For example, B2B SaaS writer Sanketee Kher says she has found several clients on Superpath by answering questions and sharing her portfolio. 

Other notable slack communities include Demand curve and Product Led Growth. In fact, almost every industry has a slack community. Find one that’s relevant and start making connections that’ll move your business forward.

To find slack communities in your industry, google “slack community” + your career field. Or ask people in your network about relevant groups they belong to.

5. Twitter Communities: Join Conversations That Create Opportunities and Improve Visibility

If you’re already on Twitter, joining a community can help grow your network on the platform.

Twitter communities are similar to Slack and Facebook groups. They’re dedicated forums where like-minded people meet to forge new connections and discuss issues that interest them. 

But more than chatting about fun things, Twitter communities present opportunities for collaborating with industry peers and experts while increasing brand visibility. 

By actively interacting with community members, you can build genuine relationships, stand out as an expert, and land new clients.

For instance, I landed my first content collaboration opportunity by connecting with a freelancer I met on #FreelanceChat, a Twitter community for freelancers. 

Several other communities exist within every industry. Find the right ones, engage in meaningful conversations, and make connections that can positively impact your business.

Even though Twitter communities can connect you with potential clients or customers, refrain from using them as an avenue to advertise yourself 24/7. Instead, concentrate on being helpful and adding value to the community. This way, it'll be easier to build trust and credibility, which will result in business connections, referrals and growth.

6. Newsletters: Discover Growth Opportunities, Stay Updated, and Gain New Perspectives.

Although newsletters sometimes get a bad rep, they’re an excellent medium for discovering business opportunities and keeping a pulse on your industry. 

Within every industry and niche, there’s a plethora of newsletters. While some tend to be very promotional, others focus on sharing ideas, growth/job opportunities and keeping their subscribers updated with the latest industry news and trends.

John Bonini’s Some Good Content is one awesome newsletter in the marketing industry. The practical frameworks, expert interviews and job opportunities he shares help subscribers sharpen their skills, discover industry experts to network with and grow their businesses. For example, Lily Ugbaja, the Founder of marketingcyborg.com, says she recently scored a freelance client by responding to a job posting in the newsletter. 

Also, Kaitlyn Arford, freelance writer and journalist, runs a newsletter where she shares weekly job opportunities for all things freelance.

One way to discover notable newsletters in your industry is to ask other professionals in your network. Finding the right newsletter may take some leg work. But once you do, you’ll benefit from the rich knowledge and opportunities they share.

7. Buzz Sumo: Get the Insight You Need to Create Great Content and Grow Your Network

After making connections online, the natural way to build professional relationships, keep conversations going and earn trust is by creating and sharing valuable content.

And Buzzsumo is the right content marketing tool to help you do that.

Buzzsumo takes the stress away from content creation by giving you insights into the type of content your network finds useful. 

﻿Its content discovery feature helps you find common knowledge gaps you can close with helpful, in-demand content.

This way, you can create content that answers important questions and form opinions that’ll make your network perceive you as a valuable, relevant person. And the outcome of such perception is increased connections, credibility and business growth. 

Quick tip: Sharing your knowledge and expertise with your network enhances your reputation and establishes you as an authority in your field.

8. Clay: Manage Your Network and Stay in Touch With the People That Matter

What’s more important than making new connections in business? 

You guessed right. 

It’s maintaining relationships with the people in your network. 

Successful business networking doesn’t end when you share your business card (or Blinq digital business card for that matter!) You need to stay in touch and check in regularly to increase your chance of generating referrals.

Clay, a new relationship-building software, works like a personal CRM to allow you keep in touch with your network regardless of the channel or platform you’re connected on.

Once you sign up with Clay and connect your Gmail, social networking platforms, contact and calendar, it’ll build a collection of your people so you can find all their details in one place. 

With Clay, you can say goodbye to entering contact details manually or switching between apps to stay updated about the people you’re connected to. Because Clay automatically populates all their information, including work history, photos, location etc and keeps them updated over time. 

But that’s not all. 

Clay lets you know when something significant happens to someone in your network. From job changes to special recognitions in industry publications to location changes and birthdays, you’ll get all the updates so you can celebrate your people in time.

The best part about using the networking tool is that it lets you search for your people the way you remember them. You can search by event, organization, where you met or what you talked about, and Clay will find the right person or people based on their profile and your notes. 

For example, when I search for SaaS on my Clay app, it brings up a list of my network who have SaaS in their profile and on my notes. It pulls this data from the different platforms we’re connected on.

A screenshot from the app Clay
From here, I can click on the particular person I want to reach out to, and Clay will show me all their personal information available on the web.

With Clay, you can prioritize your network into groups, stay connected and show that you care without breaking a sweat.

Now that we know the tools you need to make professional connections, and maintain your relationships, let’s look at the best practices for successful business networking.

Five Tips for Successful Business Networking
Professional networking exposes you to the collaborations, partnerships and mentoring opportunities necessary to grow your business or freelance career. 

By implementing these best practices, you’ll network efficiently and make better connections.

1. Always Give First

Lily Ugbaja, founder at Marketingcyborg
“A lot of people approach networking from a what can I get from it aspect, and that’s a shame because networking is about other people. The best deals, referrals and opportunities will come from just giving to people when you don’t need them yet.”
Networking only at the time you’re desperate for help is the wrong way to network. 

The truth is networking is both a skill and a mindset, with its most important aspect being generosity. By generosity, I mean committing your time, effort and resources to add value to people without any guarantee of immediate reward. 

When you focus on giving to others, you’ll be able to hold meaningful conversations, build and nurture genuine relationships that’ll help move your business and career forward. 

2. Be Proactive 
Networking is more than joining slack communities, connecting on Lunchclub or sharing your Blinq digital business card. 

Instead, it’s about actively seeking out opportunities to connect with people, learn from them and build relationships. This could involve sending cold emails to kickstart a conversation, joining conversations on socials, sending DMs to share a helpful resource you found or attending virtual/ in-person industry events and conferences.

3. Be Genuine and Authentic
People want to connect with real people. So whether you’re networking online or in person, be yourself. Be honest about your goals, your offerings and accomplishments. But try to avoid bragging! 

4. Always Follow Up
In networking, the profit is in the follow-up. The connections you make while networking are only effective if you follow them up and keep in touch. Following up keeps you at the top of your contact’s mind when opportunities that you’re an excellent fit for show up. Things like sending personalized emails or texts, reaching out regularly on socials, and meeting up for coffee or lunch are great ways to follow up and keep your relationship going.

5. Be consistent
Networking is a long-term play that requires ongoing effort. If you’re networking on online platforms, commit to spending at least an hour daily connecting, engaging and conversing with people. If you prefer to network at events and conferences, then resolve to attend more frequently.

Then, never pass up an opportunity to network by getting your Blinq digital business card today.

Personal Branding for Real Estate Agents — Here’s How

Personal Branding for Real Estate Agents — Here’s How
Real estate agents can embrace personal branding by leveraging technology, social media and blogs to win the attention and trust of prospective clients. Some of the most successful real estate agents I know realize that self-branding is a key ingredient of entrepreneurship and an incredibly powerful marketing tactic. Let’s discuss why and how to build your brand as a realtor. 

Why create a personal brand as a real estate agent?
Before we dive into the how, most agents procrastinate on the why. Both beginner and veteran real estate agents know that being a part of a team, under the umbrella of a licensed brokerage, gives them an advantage. 

Essentially, as a realtor, you’re a self-employed professional. An entrepreneur. A top player in the contact sport of selling homes. Working with a team increases your odds of winning. As the African proverb says: “if you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.”

That said, you must develop your personal brand regardless of the brand identity your brokerage (team) adopted for itself—because if you ever decided to go solo, build your own team, or jump ship to a different, stronger team—your brand will go with you and even help make those changes happen. And I think you’ll agree with me saying your prospects have developed a relationship with you, not with your brokerage. They trust you, not them.

How to brand yourself as a realtor?
The most prevalent advice online on the topic is to leverage new technology. You’ll read blog advice on how to streamline back-end clutter and automate administrative tasks. Heck, 80% of the early-stage PropTech startups I work with think their tech advantage is their branding. I’ll tell you what I told them: It’s not. Sure, technology is shifting the way real estate is built, marketed, and sold. But branding starts earlier, and to find out what it means for you, you’ll have to dig deeper.

Define who you are
Before knowing who you talk, help, and sell to — I recommend self-reflection. A person’s brand is a manifestation of their values, principles, likes, and dislikes. So, who are you, really?

You can start by asking yourself these questions:

What are my values?
What are my hobbies?
Who am I as a person? 
Am I an introvert, ambivert, or extrovert?
Do I have experience in the tech industry? 
How do I make the buying process easier for my clients?
If the roles were reversed, why would I buy a home from me?
Do I have specific experience that gives me an advantage over other realtors?
The more specific your answers, the higher the likelihood your content and external communication will align with your target audience. And you want that, because at the highest levels of real estate, buyers choose agents based on their personality, vision, and values.

Next, it's time for a mindset shift. The better you position yourself as the guide, helping the hero (your buyer/seller/tenant) reach their goal (sell/buy/lease/rent), the stronger your brand will be. 

But who is your hero?

Define your target audience
If you don’t know what tone, style, principles, and values you stand for, that’s a branding obstacle; if your website's landing page, blog, and emails don't communicate it — that’s a messaging problem, and if they do but it doesn't resonate, that’s a targeting issue. And that’s why I insist you first do self-reflection, and only then set out to see who you target. 

After that first step, audience elimination is simpler (“do I even want to work with this person?”). 

But if it's your first plunge into this sort of thing — a good method will be finding patterns with those you helped most recently. For example:

‍

Where are they similar? 
Did all of them face the same problem?
Are they all within a certain age/income group?
Maybe, coincidentally, your last 15 home sales involved helping tech employees to relocate. Maybe half of them work from home now. Or maybe you'll notice most of these tech workers are from the east coast — moving westward or leaving a specific state, which you can target. These things are worth noticing. 

‍

After starting to understand your ICP (ideal customer persona), find more patterns. That'll help you cater your content around their pains; adjust your outreach filter, and even your ads.

And of course, realtors who brand themselves like to share their Blinq digital business card on LinkedIn. These digital cards let your LinkedIn followers save your contact details with a click, so you’ll be on speed dial when they need to sell their home! Learn more about the digital business card realtors love.

Is a QR Code on a Business Card a Good Idea or a Bad Idea?
By  Andrew Childress
Freelance writer
Is a QR Code on a Business Card a Good Idea or a Bad Idea?
If you found this post, I’ll bet that you’re working on your business card. You might even be wondering: is putting a QR code on my business card a good or bad idea?

Contact details like name and phone number are a must, sure. But what about more innovative features like a QR code? Is it something that’s a must-include for 2023, or has the QR code’s moment passed?

Make no mistake: the pandemic sparked renewed interest in the QR code. In a contactless world, the QR code’s role as a touch-free launch point was essential. 

But even in a post-pandemic world, QR codes serve as a valuable “next step” for the recipient. Let’s learn more about why you should (and shouldn’t!) include a QR code. Plus, you’ll learn how to create them and add them to a business card, all in this post.

Why Your Business Card Should Include a QR Code
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but every business card has an expiration date on it.

Think about it: as soon as your employer, email address, or phone number changes, it’s out of date. That means that you’re constantly handing out a card that will soon include inaccurate and outdated contact info.

The solution? Think of a QR code as the tool that ensures your business card never expires. That’s because you can use it to send a reader to an always-up-to-date set of contact details. We call this a digital business card, and it’s the perfect launch point to include on your business card.


The QR code serves as the link to your future-proofed digital business card, where your up-to-date contact details live. You can view Robert Smith’s card here.
‍

The idea here is simple: your physical business card is easy to pass out, but your digital business card gives you flexibility long after you exchange details. The QR code on the physical business card becomes your bridge to the digital business card.

Our recommended approach is to set your QR code up to link to a digital business card. Think of this as a mini-website with all of your contact details. It’s easy to adjust the details on your digital business card with a tool like Blinq. That means that every printed business card is now essentially future-proofed.

Not a programmer? Worried about building a digital business card or printing your QR code accurately? We’ve got you covered. Read on to learn more about an easy-to-use tool to create and maintain your digital business card.

When You Shouldn’t Use A QR Code
Of course, a QR code isn’t right for every business card. It’s great to adopt new technologies, but don’t let a QR code be the tail that wags the dog. 

Your QR should have a specific purpose and use case in mind. And that means thinking about what your user will see when they open the address tied to the QR code. 

Here are a couple of occasions where it might be best to avoid using a QR code:

If you don’t plan to keep your digital business card up-to-date, then the QR code can cause more harm than good. Sending the recipient of the card to an out-of-date or defunct set of details certainly defeats the purpose.
Finally, if your customer base is more traditional and less tech-savvy, putting a QR code on your business card may take up space that could be better saved for your branding.
But above all: don’t avoid adding a QR code because you think it’s difficult or time-consuming. In fact, you can do this for free with no coding or design skills needed. Keep going to learn how to create a QR code of your own. Plus, you’ll learn about a type of card that sets the standard for the future of connection.

The Best Way to Create a QR Code For Your Business: Blinq
If you’ve decided to add a QR code to your business card, you might be faced with the all-important question: how?

Remember that the best place to send someone who scans your QR code is to a digital business card. Essentially, this is a micro website that includes all of your up-to-date contact details. But you don’t have to be a programmer to build your digital business card.

With Blinq’s digital business card builder, you can drag and drop your way to a digital business card. This gives you a QR code that you can print and share with anyone. And that QR code will take a viewer to your digital business card.


Blinq’s digital business card builder enables easy drag-and-drop creation of your digital business card.
‍

Your contact details are totally customizable. Add any detail as a new field, including social media links, chat app info, and even payment links. Because these are clickable, the digital business card far outperforms its real-world counterpart.

‍


The digital business card builder creates a QR code that links to my always-up-to-date contact details.
‍

Best of all: it’s free to get started with Blinq. That means you can generate a connected QR code and digital business card at no cost.

One other powerful feature: Blinq also has a companion app for mobile devices. Think of it as your one-stop digital Rolodex. The app collects and stores digital business cards as a one-stop shop for your network. Anyone with the app has your latest contact details at their fingertips.

NFC Business Cards: The Card of the Future
Business cards that include QR codes are largely the norm in 2023. But remember: if you share a business card, it’s likely that you seek to stand out from the crowd.

If you want even less friction - literally - then it’s time to think about NFC business cards. NFC (or near field communication) cards only require a tap to launch a link to your digital business card. Tap it on a mobile device, and you’ll instantly see a clickable link.

‍


NFC business cards help your recipient tap their way to your digital business card - no QR scanning needed.
‍

Even better news: an NFC card can include a QR code. While most devices support NFC interactivity, you can’t risk missing a connection to someone with an unsupported device. By including a QR code on your printed card, you’ll never miss an opportunity to stay in touch.

NFC cards are here to stay. They give you the easiest way to connect to a digital business card. If you want to create one of your own, read on to find out how.

How to Print Your QR-Enabled Business Card
Not all business cards are built equally. And in fact, quality matters a lot when it comes to QR codes. The quality of your printed QR code impacts the scannability. Low-resolution or blurry QR codes are less likely to scan on mobile cameras.

Luckily, Blinq gives you the freedom to create printed, high-quality business cards. That also includes NFC cards that include the tech you need for no-touch connection.

‍


After you create your digital business card, Blinq also supports printing a physical version of your card that includes a QR code and NFC tech.
These printed cards are totally optimized for your QR code. They link to the same digital business card you created on the Blinq platform. Whether touchless or QR-linked, they serve as the perfect way to send a recipient your details.

Guide: how to create your NFC Business Card

Scan Your Way to Success With QR Codes
Are QR codes on a business card good or bad? If I had to pick just one option, it’s clear: these are an excellent addition to any business card. They’re easy to add and a breeze to maintain, thanks to tools like Blinq.

Remember: the QR code is the bridge to your digital business card. You can create both your QR code and a digital business card with the help of Blinq - all for free.

Digital Business Cards for Enterprise: A 2023 Guide - Blinq
A Guide to Digital Business Cards for Enterprises
‍

You're the global sales lead at an enterprise company. So, as part of your role, you attend industry events to connect with peers and possible business partners. 

‍

During one of such events, you strike a conversation with a potential prospect. And just before you part ways, you decide to share your contact details with them. So you reach into your pocket for your company business card. But unfortunately, the one you have is outdated.

‍

You then remember that you ran out of the current business card earlier in the week but forgot to restock. And since the prospect is waiting, you fumble around trying to call out your contact details, ruining the business networking opportunity in the process.

‍

Now, this experience is common with enterprise businesses still relying on traditional business cards. Imagine how many opportunities and potential revenue such businesses have lost. That’s the reason why an alternative to paper business cards is necessary.

‍

And what's this alternative?

Digital business cards.

‍

Digital business cards make it easy for business professionals to network on-the-go and impact their bottom line.

‍

So today, I'll show you how digital business cards benefit your enterprise. I'll also reveal how Blinq, a digital business card tool for enterprises, can help your organization manage its professional identity.

‍

But first-

‍

What Are Enterprise Digital Business Cards?
‍

Digital business cards for enterprise’s are the online version of paper business cards. Also called virtual business cards, e-business cards, or smart business cards, they offer many advantages over traditional paper business cards. Examples include cost savings, portability, and environmental friendliness. 

‍

Unlike their traditional counterparts, digital business cards do not restrict the amount of information you can share. You have more real estate to add your company website, physical address, accreditations/awards, social media accounts, and even specific calls to action.

‍

Blinq’s Enterprise digital business card platform allows large organizations to create and distribute digital business cards to thousands of employees. They include additional security and user management features to ensure the responsible use of company digital business cards.

‍

How Do Enterprise Digital Business Cards Work?
‍

Enterprise digital business cards are powerful lead generation, lead capture, and networking tools. 

‍

They enable your teams to share company information and collect customer data in an innovative, convenient way. 

‍

Potential customers and partners receive your company information by scanning your QR code with their phones. 

‍

After that, they can immediately share their details with your team by completing a quick online form as seen below:


‍

This way, your teams can obtain contact details of potential leads without handing out and collecting paper cards that pile up and get outdated quickly.

‍

Thanks to their slick outlook, digital business cards help employees make a memorable impression and stand out when networking online or in person.

‍

📚Related➡ Digital business cards: What are they and why are they important?

‍

Despite the many advantages of digital business cards, some businesses still prefer to use physical business cards for various reasons.

‍

Thankfully, Blinq's NFC cards offer an innovative way for businesses to enjoy the benefits of digital business cards while wielding a physical card. Best of both worlds!

‍

NFC Cards v Digital Business Cards: What Is the Difference?

‍

It's common for companies to confuse digital business cards with NFC cards. In fact, we've seen it happen a lot with customers. The obvious reason is that both allow you to share who you are with anyone wherever you go. However, they have some important differences. 

‍

Digital business cards are the virtual cards you keep on your phone, tablet, or laptop. They have a QR code that recipients can scan to receive your information.
On the other hand, an NFC card is a physical tappable card you can carry around. It's embedded with a chip connected to your digital business card account. To receive your information, the recipient has to tap your NFC card on their smartphone.
‍

NFC cards eliminate the need to print multiple cards and reprint them every time company or employee information changes. Since they connect to a live digital business card profile, you can edit your information anytime, and your new contacts will receive the updated information whenever they tap your card.

‍

‍

Other Ways to Share Your Enterprise Digital Business Card
Apart from asking customers to scan an NFC card or the QR code on their phones, employees can share their digital business cards in a few other ways.

By text, web links, or emails
Via QR codes on apple watches
Smartphone widgets
Add your QR code to posters, stickers, t-shirts, and other marketing materials.
What Are the Benefits of Digital Business Cards for Enterprises?
1. Better and Consistent Branding
Digital business cards allow you to create team card templates with your preferred information fields and brand materials. This ensures consistency across your teams. With templates, you can stay in control of the information being shared on every business card while ensuring they're always up to date.

2. Save on Card Printing Costs
According to CreditDonkey, it costs an average of $194 for companies to design and print one pack of  paper business cards. And that depends on the design, quality, and card company. Now imagine printing thousands of cards for different offices and employees. The cost can quickly add up. 

‍

On the flip side, enterprise digital business card platforms allow you to generate and share an unlimited amount of digital business cards without spending on design and printing. 

‍

Moreso, when you change company information or make a new hire, there's no need to redistribute your card or worry about outdated information being in circulation. 

‍

Digital business cards are always live. So every change you make updates across all recipient devices, keeping your information up to date.

‍

3. Improve Communication 
Digital business cards encourage future contact. Sales reps and marketers no longer have to worry about customers and partners losing their information because their contact details are saved on the recipient's phone. Now, customers can reach out long after they receive your details. Plus, the ability to customize employee business cards with their headshots helps customers connect a face to their point of contact. Thus, increasing credibility and authenticity and improving customer-client relationships.

‍

4. Track Networking Efforts and Measure ROI 
No more blind networking. Gain insights into how people interact with your business cards, so you know where and how to further connections. You can also see which employees are performing better by tracking the number of card scans. This way, you can optimize your networking efforts and spend.

‍

5. Go contactless. Go green
Statistics show that about 2 million trees are used to manufacture paper business cards every year. Plus, Adobe reports that 88% of all the business cards your teams hand out get trashed in less than a week. This report was far back in 2016, so imagine how high those numbers would be in this digitally charged age.

‍

Digital business cards, on the other hand, help companies cut their carbon footprint and behave in a sustainable way. By adopting sustainable business cards, you help keep more trees in the ground and make the planet safer.

‍

Enterprise Use Cases for Digital Business Cards
‍

Now you've seen how digital business cards can benefit your organization. It's time to share ways your enterprise can use Blinq enterprise digital business cards.

‍

1. Set up Team Card Templates and Manage Employee Access 
Enterprises usually have several offices, with thousands of employees needing business cards every year. 

‍

So you'll agree that the larger your organization, the harder it is to monitor how employees represent your brand. Also, controlling company information in circulation can become difficult as employees come and go. 

‍

But with Blinq, you can say goodbye to these concerns. 

‍

Our digital business card solution is designed to help companies maintain brand consistency. Hence, our platform comes with administrative controls. These controls allow you to set team templates with your brand colors and preferred company information. You can create unlimited templates for different departments, offices, and teams. These templates then form the foundation to create your team's digital business cards.


‍

One of the best aspects of team templates is you can prevent employees from overriding specific functions when creating their cards. Also, locking functions can prevent them from adding inappropriate information like their personal social media. 

‍

Our Growth Operations Lead, Harrison Coull, shares why enterprise customers love this feature.

‍

"Admins love the ability to lock features on the card, so there is symmetry across the team. They also love the ability to lock features off the card, preventing anyone adding personal links that aren't appropriate for work, like personal social media accounts" - Harrison Coull.

‍

Now, every team template you create on Blinq is live. This means whenever you edit a template, all the employee cards using that template will update in real-time to reflect the current information.

‍

💡[Embed]➡How to set up Blinq templates for Teams 

‍

As an admin, you can add and delete users from your dashboard. And when employees leave, you're assured of the safety of your information because you can effortlessly cancel their card and assign it to a new user. This gives you more security and control over the information being shared with your enterprise digital business card. 

‍

As our Growth Operations Manager said:

‍

"We hear from team admins that the ability to take charge, create, modify, and update team cards alleviates a lot of upkeep time for the whole team and ensures consistency of branding and information across all cards."  

- Sam Barnes, Growth Operations Manager.

‍

2. Automate Lead Capture With Powerful CRM Integration
‍

This probably sounds familiar:

‍

Your customer-facing teams attend networking events. They distribute hundreds or thousands of business cards and gather a similar number in return. 

‍

Then, they spend hours keying in the contact details from those paper cards into your CRM system or an excel spreadsheet. 

‍

How many hours of admin work do you think that costs you yearly? 

‍

Not to mention that the boring, tedious task of manually entering information is prone to errors.

‍

So, what is the better way to capture customer information? 

‍

You guessed right—Blinq's enterprise digital business cards.

‍

When potential leads share their information after scanning your QR code, their details are immediately added to your admin dashboard.

‍

You'll see their contact information, the employees they interacted with, and the day they scanned your company card. From there, you can easily export contacts to your CRM for nurturing. 

‍

Blinq automatically integrates with Hubspot and Salesforce. And we can connect to thousands of other CRM through Zapier. 

‍

To save your team some time, connect Blinq to your CRM to automatically sync and export your contacts every time they're updated.

‍

‍

"Teams, especially sales and procurement teams, love that their new contacts pull through automatically and smoothly to their CRM connections without them needing to interfere at all!" 

- Travis James, Growth Operations Manager

‍

3. Automate Card Creation For Teams by Linking With Your HR Directory
‍

Linking your Blinq digital business card account to an active directory like Azure AD streamlines creating, updating, and distributing team cards in bulk.

‍

When new hires join your team and the HR directory updates, a new digital business card can automatically be generated. Promotions can also be applied to employee business cards in real-time. No need to spend resources redesigning, reprinting, and distributing cards every time there's an internal company change.

‍

4. Equip Your Customer-Facing Teams to Network at Scale
‍

Technology has changed business networking in many ways. With customers relying more on software, adopting innovative methods shows you're a forward-thinking company.

‍

Digital business cards set you apart from the competition and help your company network in a modern and effective way.

‍

With Blinq, your teams will never worry about forgetting their cards or running out when it's most important. That's because their business cards are always with them. In their phones, smartwatches, laptops, and tablets. 

‍

New contacts need not have the Blinq app to receive your company information. They can quickly scan your QR code or tap your NFC card to download your details into their phone. 

‍

During in-person networking events or marketing campaigns, you can download your QR code as an image and add it to t-shirts, billboards, and other marketing materials. This will make distributing company information 10X easier. Plus, your QR code is static. So even when you update company information, it stays the same.

‍

The thought of losing customer information or forgetting who you had conversations with also becomes a thing of the past. Now your teams can follow up easily and build better connections with leads.

5. Secure Your Data
 

Digital business cards contain your employee's personal and professional information. So, keeping this data safe is a priority. 

‍

Here at Blinq, we understand the importance of data privacy and security. So, we guarantee the safety of your information. We encrypt your data in transit and at rest and follow industry best practices to ensure a security-first approach in our software development lifecycle.

‍

We'll never sell your data. We use reputable third-party security vendors to monitor and manage security controls to meet SOC2 standards. And we review all vendors to ensure they meet the same security requirements we apply ourselves to.

Are Digital Business Cards Worth It? We Think So!

Are Digital Business Cards Worth It? We Think So!
Are you thinking of getting digital business cards, but are unsure they’re worth the investment? In this blog, I’ll outline some of the reasons I think they’re worthwhile!

As part of my research for this article, I interviewed people like you — realtors, salespeople, and small business owners — to find out why they thought digital business cards were worth it

Here are some reasons they gave:

1. They're free to update if your role or contact information changes

2. Gives unlimited space to accommodate your personal details

3. Makes it easy for prospects and customers to contact you

4. Cuts costs

5. Reduces your carbon footprint.

6. Integrates with CRM and active directories to aid follow ups

7. Facilitates networking across geographical boundaries

8. Providers like Blinq let you try them for free to make your own mind up

Digital business cards: Reasons they’re worth it
1. They're free to update if your role or contact information changes
Traditional business cards become redundant each time you get a new job title or phone number. No matter how good your old cards are, you must purchase new ones.

With Blinq digital business cards, there’s no need to purchase new cards every time your information changes. 

Simply log into the Blinq application or web dashboard. Update your information. And click save. That’s all.

2. Gives unlimited space to accommodate your personal details
An average printed business card is 3.5x2.0 inches. In most cases, it can't accommodate all your information.

In contrast, digital business cards are large enough to accommodate all details you’d like to add. And contacts can zoom in on any portion if they need a clearer view.

Amazing, right?

Take a look at the card I created:


All my professional information is on the card. None of my details are squished together or illegible. Plus there's still space to add more information if I wish to. 

Need a bit more information about digital business cards?Learn more about how digital business cards work.

3. Makes it easy for prospects and customers to contact you
I find that it’s difficult for people to contact you via paper business cards. 

Firstly, they must manually copy out your details. And they can't reach you if they misspell a  word or miss a single digit.

Also, not everyone may be patient enough to copy your details from a paper card. It takes time and focus to avoid making a mistake.

With a digital business card, all a client does is tap, and they’re immediately redirected to your social media profiles, website, payment platform, and so on.

They can even book meetings and call directly from Blinq’s Calendly and click-to-call icons respectively. This makes it easier for prospects to reach you.

4. Cuts costs
Paper-based business cards cost a lot.

A stack of 100 cards costs anywhere from $10-50 (or 0.10-0.50 cents per card), depending on the paper stock used, design elements, printing method, and whether it’s one-sided or two-sided.

I’m sure you’d agree with me that the cost is too high for a piece of paper that will likely get missing, end up in a landfill, or remain in a closed cabinet for eternity

Additionally, cards with the lowest costs have lower quality. And as a professional, your card says a lot about your expertise.

Digital business cards reduce costs in many ways.

You can create your card yourself, without hiring a graphic designer. 

All you need are your brand’s color palette and logo, links to your socials and website, and personal details you’d like to add.

Also, Blinq enables you to create your first two business cards for free. While the Premium or Business plans start from $4.99 per month.

5. Reduces your carbon footprint
Paper business cards contribute to the destruction of the environment.

A recent study reports that the paper and pulp industry is the third largest contributor to industrial pollution in the United States of America.

Also, most paper business cards end up in landfills since they’re made of glossy or coated paper, which cannot be recycled. 

Digital business cards are sustainable. They don't cause the felling of trees. And they don't end up in landfills.

So, by using digital business cards, you play your role in protecting the environment as you connect with contacts.

6. Integrates with CRM and active directories to aid follow ups
With digital business cards, you can centralize the contact information of every person who shares their details with you. This makes it easy to turn contacts to leads and grow mutually beneficial relationships. 

For instance, Blinq business’ Zapier integration connects with CRM (customer relationship management) tools like Salesforce, Hubspot, and Zoho. Your contacts can export automatically to your CRM. 

Also, you can download the CSV file of your contacts. Simply click Contacts<export contacts<download CSV from your dashboard.

This way, you keep in touch with contacts, nurture warm leads, and turn them into clients.

7. Facilitates networking across geographical boundaries
Virtual networking events and meetings are now commonplace. 

In a recent survey by LinkedIn, 28% of marketers said 90-100% of their events are now virtual. 

Digital business cards help you network during these events.

You can share them via email, text message, LinkedIn private message, and so on.


Also, Blinq lets you create a virtual background with your QR code. Here’s what mine looks like:


Anyone that scans the QR code is automatically redirected to my digital business card.

8. Providers like Blinq let you try them for free to make your own mind up
Imagine this scenario:

You pay for a large delivery of paper business cards. Upon opening the package, you discover that they don't meet your needs or preferences. The money you spent vanishes with no result.

That’s the risk of paper business cards.

No printing service offers a free trial card to let you see if the investment is worth it before you commit. 

But on Blinq's free plan, you get two free digital business cards with unlimited shares. You can give them out, measure their impact, and decide if you want to invest in them.

Create a free digital business card on Blinq today.

How to get the most out of a digital business card
Ensure your digital business card is visually appealing and easy to read
The design of your card should be attractive and professional to capture attention and present you as a professional.

When designing your card, keep these in mind:

✅ Avoid clutter: it shouldn’t be cluttered with information. Keep it clean and simple.

✅ Arrange your details hierarchically. Your name should be the first thing on your digital card. Followed by your title. And so on.

✅ Ensure the font sizes are legible

✅ Your brand and card design should align. Add your color palette and Logo.

You can use these examples of digital business cards as a guide. We’ve also got industry-specific articles for realtors, digital nomads, and photographers!

Add a high-quality headshot
A great headshot exudes confidence, competence, and professionalism. It plays a huge role in determining people’s perceptions of you.

Your headshot should align with your brand, and be of high quality to avoid pixelation.

Blinq has curated a list of 15 great professional headshots. You can use it as a guide. 

Include essential links
Provide contacts with different ways to reach you. 

This includes

✅ Social media links 

✅ Links to your Website or landing page

✅ Links to your Payment information

✅ Links to your Scheduling pages (Calendly, Google Calendar, etc)

This way, they can contact you from your business card. 

Demonstrate expertise by linking to your eBook
Including a link to your eBook card tells potential clients, partners, or employers you’re an expert. They will be more likely to trust you and do business with you.

Repurpose it 
There are different ways to use a digital business card.

✅ Share it in the bios of your social media accounts

✅ Include it in your ad campaigns

✅ Embed it on your website. We have a guide on how to embed your digital business card on your website.

✅ Include the QR code in your company merch

Use it as your email signature
You can use your digital business cards as email signatures. This makes it simple for others to get in touch with you, while also projecting an expert image to those who receive your emails.

Blinq lets you create your email signature from your dashboard. 

Simply import your details from your digital card, click save, then add it to your email account.

Share your digital business card on social media
You reach a wider audience and increase online visibility by sharing your digital business card on social media.

Add your QR code to the virtual background during meetings

Our Excel templates for realtors are designed to do that. You’ll get helpful cues that remind you what to record, track, and analyze.

A spreadsheet’s rows and columns give you the structure to capture every detail about your clients, your properties, or your investments. Instead of leaving these details to memory, use a spreadsheet as the brain for your real estate business.

In this post, we’re sharing 7 Excel templates realtors are sure to benefit from! Whether you’re using a spreadsheet to track leads, calculate a profitable investment, or run a property, we’ve got you covered.

7 Customer Service Skills All Amazing Realtors Possess

7 Customer Service Skills All Amazing Realtors Possess
If you’re reading this, you’re probably a junior realtor. And that’s ok. The trail to a mountain’s peak starts at its bottom, and all masters started as students. So, here are the seven customer service skills amazing realtors possess.

My first experience with a realtor
First, a story from my own personal experience.

When I bought my first investment property in 2017, I was 26 years of age, I purposefully chose a small, family-owned team, because it was my very first professional interaction as a buyer, and needed a guiding hand—to not just help me with the paperwork—but educate me on things I’m yet to discover. My chosen agent and his team (his wife and one assistant) didn’t believe this B-class property was a good deal, but I insisted, having noticed some serious market trends. 

Long story short, I ended up buying a condominium next to UNLV (University of Las Vegas).

I knew the current tenant was paying $600 a month, that they were about to leave the apartment, and if I put about $4k into fixing and furnishing it, I could rent it for $200 more. My agent didn’t believe it’ll rent for $800. Guess what? It did.

For twelve months the property cash-flowed. Then, I wanted to sell. 

We found a buyer from California, and everything went smoothly. I bought it for $60k, and sold it for $89k. However, after the paperwork was signed, and money was in escrow, on the very last day of the process, Murphy's law hit me with a pipe leak. And my agent? He was on vacation and uncontactable.

His trusty assistant (who was genuinely superb) was also on vacation. There wasn’t anyone at the firm who could help me or reassure me and he hadn’t put a substitute agent in place. Being a newbie, I freaked out. Now that I’m a bit more experienced, and after the deal did go through, I know I overreacted, but ultimately, the agent could have provided better customer service. 

Here’s why.

7 Customer service skills amazing realtors have
1. Setting up an emergency line
Ok, it’s not a skill, but my story emphasizes this perfectly. The feeling of helplessness left a bitter taste in my mouth. It actually made me not want to work with him anymore. Everyone deserves a vacation, and deals happen year-long, but it was his responsibility to have at least one operating member on his team able to respond if/when emergencies (or urgent calls) happen. Don’t be that agent who leaves no one at the helm. Ever.

2. Communication
Clear communication is the backbone of every human interaction, especially in deal-making; and even more so when it involves an emotional purchase carrying a high-ticket price, like a house.

3. Setting expectations
Explain the process, timeline, and what’s required from you and your client for everything to go smoothly. If the commission from smaller deals like mine won’t appeal to you, refer to someone else. If you only specialize in selling homes to families, not condos for investors, say so. 

4. Balancing sales and service
Understand the difference between selling and helping. In a perfect scenario—and those happen—these two align. But sometimes, agents can cross the line, mistake the grey zone, and blur the boundaries. If it’s a win for you but not so much for the other sides (seller and/or buyer), then maybe this quick gain (think: fat check) isn’t worth tarnishing your brand over (long-term referrals and reputation). 

5. Be transparent
Even at the cost of losing a client. Be radically honest, and tell your client if you know the agent on the other side, how it affects the deal, how much fees and commission are involved, and why.

6. Be empathetic
To be empathetic, you’ll have to employ active listening and go beyond just hearing what is said. You’ll have to understand what is said, and why. Ryan Serhant once shared he was able to sell a mansion to a wealthy person just because he realized, after actively listening, that this home purchase is happening because he’s getting divorced, and as a father, he really cares about the new rooms of his two daughters. So Ryan focused his showings in this instance on homes with unique, spacious, and cozy kid rooms.

7. Be knowledgeable 
Being able to educate your clients and guide them throughout the process is key to providing best-in-class customer service. Paradoxically, this can eliminate future complaints—and complaints are what we think about when we say “customer service”. So, let’s call being knowledgeable “preventative customer service”.

Bonus: Know your audience
At the time, five years ago, I thought a realtor is a realtor, without being able to distinguish between different types of agents. I told my agent I am going to lease the property. But in hindsight, my realtor worked with home buyers, or mortgage to own, not mortgage to lease (I paid cash, but it’s the mindset and knowledge we’re talking about), and yet he onboarded me even though he didn’t specialize in what I needed.

Knowing who you serve is the foundation of providing them with quality customer service.

Now that you know to focus on communication, expectations, the difference between selling and helping, transparency, empathy, knowing your audience, and how important it is to set up an emergency line, you’re one step ahead of other agents!

15 Great Professional Headshot Examples (And Why They Work)
In 2019, a San-Franscisco-based headshot studio commissioned a four months study to prove the importance of professional headshots. They asked 243 randomly selected people to rate the competence, likeability, and influence of 3 participants based only on their headshots. For comparison, they provided 1 professional headshot and 1 low-quality image of each participant. 

The result? Professional headshots led to a 76% increase in how competent each participant appeared. It also increased their likeability and influence by 9% and 62%, respectively. 

What does this tell you?

It tells me that in this era of on-screen first impressions, the professional imagery you put forward influences people’s perceptions of you. And in a big way.

Whether you’re getting ready to land your next job or  to network with other professionals, a professional headshot presents you in the best light and makes others take you seriously.

So, today, I’ll show you 15 great professional headshot examples to inspire your next headshot shoot. I’ve sourced these headshots from across the web from a range of different industries. I’ve also rounded up expert tips (from pro photographers) for getting the best professional headshots.

But first —

What Makes A Great Headshot?
A confident, competent, and organized look that tells people who come across your online profile or digital business card that you know your stuff. 

Because a headshot is to your personal brand what a logo is to a company, Dan Lewis, pro photographer at Badassity Brand Photography, says its job is to represent your unique personality, style, and energy.

He says a great headshot should be a mix of

authority
empathy and
approachability. 
At first glance, a person should be able to form an impression of who you are and decide whether you’re worth connecting with. This means your pose, outfit, and backdrop should be consistent with your personal brand and resonate with the people you’re connecting with. 

Now that you know what a great headshot should look like, here are some headshot examples from different professions to inspire your headshot shoot.

15 Great Professional Headshot Examples and Why They Work
1. A Realtor Headshot Which Gives Off an Approachable Vibe
‍


source: LinkedIn
How do you imagine a realtor’s headshot should look? 

I’d say professional, trustworthy, and kind, given the nature of their job. And that’s exactly how Damian’s LinkedIn headshot looks. 

Whether you’re a male or female real estate agent, a formal business look helps define the kind of business you run. To that, a nice jacket, dress shirt, a tie (if male), and warm smile send just the right message — I’m the professional you can trust.

Even though Damian’s outfit gives his headshot a serious formal look, his warm smile and soft gaze make him look very approachable. Just from this headshot, you’d agree he’s the kind of realtor anyone would choose to work with.

2. A Freelance Writer's Headshot With a Compelling Look

Source: Twitter
Freelance content writer Orgesa gets so many things right with her headshot. First, the plain background works well with her hair, outfit, and brand colors to keep the attention on her face. 

Then her subtle smile and focused gaze make her appear compelling and likable. And if you’re a writer, that’s the kind of perception you’d want potential clients and industry peers to have when they come across your profile. 

3. A Creative Headshot Example for A Graphic Designer

Source: Twitter
What I love about Maggie’s headshot is the creativity and thought she put into it. 

From her pose to the grayscale theme, you can tell she understands the importance of showing off her personality while maintaining a tasteful look.

The days of wearing only formal outfits for professional headshots are long gone, especially if you work in a creative industry.

Now, when you network with professionals online, they want to see and connect with the personality behind your brand. So, if you’re a creative, capture it in your headshot. Let people get a hint of who you are by looking at the image on your profile.

4. A Sporting Director Headshot With a Smart, Impressive Look

Source: Twitter
I love how Chris’s formal outfit and studio setting give his headshot a professional look consistent with his industry. However, his big smile and happy eyes convey a relaxed, friendly personality which is great for creating an instant connection with people.

5. A Solopreneur With a Self-Assured Headshot

Source: Twitter
If you plan to become a successful solopreneur, then you understand that you’re the brand and the business. Therefore, you must look the part at all times, beginning with your headshot. 

Justin Welsh’s Twitter headshot gets it right. 

As someone who works primarily with early-stage startups and entrepreneurs, the dark background, stern look, and glint in his eyes send a powerful message—I’m confident, resilient, and professional.

One look at his headshot, and you’d think he's a serious businessman. And for someone whose business is building an audience and connecting with other professionals online, that’s a great first impression.

6. A Photographer’s Headshot With a Cheerful, Welcoming Vibe

Source: LinkedIn
For photographers, the feelings your headshot evokes give people a hint of what to expect should they decide to shoot with you. 

Glynns’ headshot exudes a calm, friendly feeling, which can build trust with potential clients. Her wide smile invites you to relax while she helps you create the professional portraits you desire.

From the way she holds her camera up, you can tell she’s a photographer before you read her headline. Including an object or backdrop that shows your business or brand is always a great idea as long as it’s not distracting.

💡Pro Tip → If you’re a photographer, learn more about Blinq, the digital business cards photographers love.

7. An Architect’s Headshot With a Look of Competence

Source: Twitter
One thing Marica’s headshot gets right is it relates to the field she works in. Her jacket, hairstyle, and facial expression exude competence, the core quality expected of architects. The environmental background acts as a prop and adds context to her photo.

Even though she works in a professional field, her casual pose and genuine smile give off a cool, approachable vibe. 

8. A Non-Profit Worker With an Environmental Style Headshot

Source: LinkedIn
The non-profit sector is often less formal than its corporate counterpart. So, a lovely outdoor headshot like Caroline’s is a great idea if you’re a charity or social worker.

Caroline’s wide smile gives her headshot a kind, authentic outlook. Her direct gaze is great for creating an emotional connection with the viewer. The natural background also brings a calm feeling that’s in line with her industry. 

9. A Marketing Director’s Headshot With a Professional, Confident Look

Source: LinkedIn
People who work in marketing know that faces are a powerful part of personal branding. 

A great headshot on your social profiles makes you look competent and builds a sense of trust with prospective clients and industry peers. 

Take Adam’s headshot as an example. His sharp formal outfit and business-inspired silhouette are relatable to other professionals in his field. 

His calm facial expression also sends a powerful message—I’m the guy you can trust to deliver successful outcomes for your business.

10. An Event Manager’s Headshot With a Nice Casual Look

Source: LinkedIn
For someone who works in the hospitality industry, Katherine's LinkedIn headshot does a great job of balancing business with casual. 

Her nice outfit, charming smile, and backdrop align with her lifestyle brand.

‍👀Did you know?→ You can instantly share your headshot and other contact details with a single tap. Create your free Blinq card here 💡

11. A Captivating Chef Headshot

Source: Twitter
I’d say Takashi's headshot is everything a chef's headshot should be—illustrative and professional. 

Though taken indoors, the natural light combines with his outfit and relaxed pose to give his headshot a captivating look. 

As a chef, your headshot should reflect your style and personality as much as your food does. 

So if the classic chef pose isn't your mojo, feel free to try something less traditional like smiling, laughing, or garnishing a dish.

12. A Vibrant Social Media Manager Headshot

Source: LinkedIn
What I love the most about Kassandra’s LinkedIn headshot is the overall play of colors. The solid background, green outfit, and dark hair work together to make her face and expression sparkle.

Considering the saturated industry she works in, a headshot like this helps her stand out. 

At first glance, she checks a lot of boxes. Creative. Great personality. Approachable. These are traits business owners look for when hiring social media managers. So, make sure the headshot you put forward represents you accordingly!

13. A Psychologist's Headshot With a Friendly Look

Source: LinkedIn
For psychologists, it's important to balance professionalism with personality. If you’re meeting clients on social media, your headshot should communicate who you are and give them a hint of what it’s like to sit with you.

Take Jennifer's LinkedIn headshot as an example. She looks happy, friendly, and inviting—an awesome first impression for a psychologist and a great way to build trust with new clients.

The soft lighting combines with her smile and natural look to give the impression that she’s a kind and gentle person. It looks like she’s saying:, “l see you, you can speak to me, I want to listen.”

14. A Journalist's Headshot With a Calm, Collected Look

Source: LinkedIn
Part of being a journalist is approaching people you don’t know to ask for interviews. As such, a friendly and professional headshot goes a long way in determining whether they’ll decide to speak to you.

Take a look at Beth’s headshot.

It looks professional but is also inviting and approachable. 

The studio lighting, plain background, and warm colors keep the viewer's attention on her face. Her slightly forward posture, appearance, and facial expression all feel soft and calming.

15. An Author’s Headshot With a Relaxed, Fun Vibe

Source: LinkedIn
If you’re an author, then understand that an impressive headshot is not only essential for your personal brand. It also gets people interested in reading your book. 

Look at Roger Neilsen’s LinkedIn headshot. It’s

neat
looks intelligent and 
interesting.
The bright lighting and plain studio background keep the focus on his face. And though his outfit is business-like, his pose and facial expression suggest a fun and welcoming personality. It wouldn’t be out of place to assume his book will match his image. 

Now, as you use the above examples as inspiration, keep the following tips from professional photographers in mind.

Top 4 easy ways to make your headshot look professional
1. Make Sure You Use Great Lighting
Whether it’s natural or artificial studio lighting, good lighting is key to getting a great professional headshot, says Paul Smith, headshot photographer at Paul David Smith Photography. He recommends taking some shots in both a studio and a natural setting.


Paul David Smith
“Professional photographers have studio flashes they can control. But if taking shots indoors using natural light, then ensure you have the photo taken near the window, so lots of light falls on your face. If outdoors, try to avoid direct sunlight as they make you backlit”.
2. Dress Properly and Comfortably

Darren Irwin, Headshot Photographer at Newcastle Headshots.
"You should dress in a way that represents your personal brand, specifically how your colleagues and clients would expect to see you.”
According to professional head photographer Richard Waine, your headshot won’t look great if you’re not comfortable in your outfit. Therefore, he recommends using the clothes you love as they help boost your confidence in front of the camera. However, they shouldn’t be overly busy or distracting.

3. Avoid Cluttered or Distracting Backgrounds
Cluttered or distracting backgrounds with bold patterns and logos detract from your image and take the focus away from you. You should also make sure the backgrounds you choose, whether indoor or outdoor, work well with your choice of outfit.

4. Be Yourself
The best professional headshot looks natural and brings out your best features. So, Paul David Smith recommends not overthinking or overdoing your facial expression.

What is The Best Color to Wear For a Professional Headshot?
When it comes to colors, both dark and light colors can work well. However, dark, solid colors do a better job of highlighting your features, says Chris Cottrell, headshot photographer at Cottrell Photographers.

What Outfit Should a Woman Wear For a Professional Headshot? 
Headshot and commercial photographer, Glynns Thomas suggests using simple well-fitted clothing that keeps the focus on your face instead of your outfit. For instance, v-necks and button-down shirts can give you a lovely neck length, while flowy, loose-fitting clothes make you look bigger on camera.

How to Prepare For Your Professional Headshot
Choose a photographer who specializes in headshot photography: Heike Martin, a headshot and branding photographer recommends choosing a headshot photographer you connect with on a personal level. According to her, such a photographer will communicate in a transparent and friendly manner. They’ll also help you relax, prepare for the shoot, and have an amazing experience, which will impact the quality of the images you get.
Pick your outfits early, then press them to ensure they’re free from wrinkles, pet hair, and lint (studio light can pick those up).
Get some rest before your shoot so you can relax better in front of the camera.
Prepare to spend a decent amount of time in there because rushing can affect the quality of your headshots. 
Go into your headshot ready to have some fun and a few laughs. 
Get Ready to Share Your Professional Headshot With Blinq

Digital Transformation in Real Estate: How to Adapt in 2023

Digital Transformation in Real Estate: How to Adapt in 2023
Digital transformation in real estate started about a decade ago, with the PropTech (property technology) sector raising $250 million in venture capital. But in 2022, PropTech reached mesmerizing heights, as VC poured $13.1 billion into the industry, causing it to outperform the global venture capital market. In 2023, in order to adapt to these digital transformations in real estate, pay attention to these trends.

Digital journeys 
43% of US homebuyers are millennials, and 63% of clients are more likely to return to websites providing virtual chat support. Combining these two stats with common sense proves younger buyers, as they naturally grow older and seek a home, will become your target audience, and that because they grew up in a digitally interconnected, agile environment — their expectations of a digital journey will no longer just be expectations — but requirements. 

Millennials will avoid bureaucracy and flee to brokerages and agents who digitally adapted to reduce clunky processes and slow paperwork for smoother digital journeys.

But what is a digital journey? 

Well, everything that your client needs to go through in the buying/selling process, from start to finish — with a focus on the parts that can be made faster and more efficient — regardless of physical location. Yep — it goes beyond digital signatures. Think of:

Offers
Quotes
Real-time transaction tracking
Loan applications and processing
Document management and file sharing
Scheduling and following up on appointments
And even the property showing itself. Now digital property showings go beyond pictures and video. Online 2D showings aren’t enough anymore, and startups like Giraffe 360 and Matterport are making 3D property showings common.

VR/AR (virtual/augmented reality)
Let’s elaborate on that last point and talk about virtual and augmented reality. First, let’s clarify: AR uses a real-world setting while VR is completely virtual.

In 2020, when I consulted Matterport before they went public via SPAC for $3.5 billion, I wrote for Wealth Magazine (BiggerPockets) on how AR/VR is here to stay, and how the pandemic was just a catalyst for an already gushing trend.

And indeed, in 2021, Redfin revealed that in June 2020, 45% of home purchases were made through remote digital tours, and in December 2020, it jumped to a staggering 63%. 

Back then, it was a necessity, as flights were not an option due to an ongoing pandemic.  But today, the world has gone back to normal — a new normal — because those times of need changed the barometer of what digital tools mean for comfort, accessibility, and necessity.

Now, buyers not only know this tech exists — they expect it — as it makes buying houses in different states, countries, and even continents easier. Even if flying to a home viewing is a possibility, why do so if you can do it from your couch? Don’t just think of wealthy people buying extra homes. Think of the family relocating due to one of the parents’ job change. This family is now able to find their new home after two days of couch-sitting and iPad scrolling.

And as time passes, awareness of these technologies will increase across different age groups, and as your consumer base naturally becomes older in age but younger in tech adoption, they will have become accustomed to these trends — seeing their friends (and even parents) buy a home this way. Then, as more people get used to such advancements, they will become a requirement for them.

This can all sound intimidating, but it’s also a blessing. Suddenly, showings are not restricted by physical presence, you’re not limited by your zip code, and your buyers can come from everywhere.

Chatbots
Remember how 63% of people browsing the web are more likely to come back to websites with virtual chat support? Setting up such a system is crucial for a digital transformation. It’ll enable your brokerage to segment your audience based on their needs and questions, and save on labor costs — helping with basic customer support inquiries.

But that’s not new — the sector has been doing that for quite some time now. In 2023, with advancements in tech, some smarter chatbots like Tidio can assist your customers with more aspects of the real estate business, like finding the right property and helping with financial transactions.

However, this is a double-edged sword. If you become this brokerage that’s perceived as robotic — because of its messaging, or because getting to a human is a chore — it’ll backfire. For this to work, you need to have the right balance of human/chat interaction, create ultra-personalized chatbot responses; for the UX/UI and copy to be superb; flow well; and feel human-like.

‍

A final thought on digital transformation
‍

Now you know more about what digital transformations to pay attention to in 2023, focusing on digital journeys, VR/AR showings, and smart chatbots. And of course, realtors who brand themselves like to share their Blinq digital business card on LinkedIn. These digital cards let your LinkedIn followers save your contact details with a click, so you’ll be on speed dial when they need to sell their home!

7 Customer Service Skills All Amazing Realtors Possess
If you’re reading this, you’re probably a junior realtor. And that’s ok. The trail to a mountain’s peak starts at its bottom, and all masters started as students. So, here are the seven customer service skills amazing realtors possess.

My first experience with a realtor
First, a story from my own personal experience.

When I bought my first investment property in 2017, I was 26 years of age, I purposefully chose a small, family-owned team, because it was my very first professional interaction as a buyer, and needed a guiding hand—to not just help me with the paperwork—but educate me on things I’m yet to discover. My chosen agent and his team (his wife and one assistant) didn’t believe this B-class property was a good deal, but I insisted, having noticed some serious market trends. 

Long story short, I ended up buying a condominium next to UNLV (University of Las Vegas).

I knew the current tenant was paying $600 a month, that they were about to leave the apartment, and if I put about $4k into fixing and furnishing it, I could rent it for $200 more. My agent didn’t believe it’ll rent for $800. Guess what? It did.

For twelve months the property cash-flowed. Then, I wanted to sell. 

We found a buyer from California, and everything went smoothly. I bought it for $60k, and sold it for $89k. However, after the paperwork was signed, and money was in escrow, on the very last day of the process, Murphy's law hit me with a pipe leak. And my agent? He was on vacation and uncontactable.

His trusty assistant (who was genuinely superb) was also on vacation. There wasn’t anyone at the firm who could help me or reassure me and he hadn’t put a substitute agent in place. Being a newbie, I freaked out. Now that I’m a bit more experienced, and after the deal did go through, I know I overreacted, but ultimately, the agent could have provided better customer service. 

Here’s why.

7 Customer service skills amazing realtors have
1. Setting up an emergency line
Ok, it’s not a skill, but my story emphasizes this perfectly. The feeling of helplessness left a bitter taste in my mouth. It actually made me not want to work with him anymore. Everyone deserves a vacation, and deals happen year-long, but it was his responsibility to have at least one operating member on his team able to respond if/when emergencies (or urgent calls) happen. Don’t be that agent who leaves no one at the helm. Ever.

2. Communication
Clear communication is the backbone of every human interaction, especially in deal-making; and even more so when it involves an emotional purchase carrying a high-ticket price, like a house.

3. Setting expectations
Explain the process, timeline, and what’s required from you and your client for everything to go smoothly. If the commission from smaller deals like mine won’t appeal to you, refer to someone else. If you only specialize in selling homes to families, not condos for investors, say so. 

4. Balancing sales and service
Understand the difference between selling and helping. In a perfect scenario—and those happen—these two align. But sometimes, agents can cross the line, mistake the grey zone, and blur the boundaries. If it’s a win for you but not so much for the other sides (seller and/or buyer), then maybe this quick gain (think: fat check) isn’t worth tarnishing your brand over (long-term referrals and reputation). 

5. Be transparent
Even at the cost of losing a client. Be radically honest, and tell your client if you know the agent on the other side, how it affects the deal, how much fees and commission are involved, and why.

6. Be empathetic
To be empathetic, you’ll have to employ active listening and go beyond just hearing what is said. You’ll have to understand what is said, and why. Ryan Serhant once shared he was able to sell a mansion to a wealthy person just because he realized, after actively listening, that this home purchase is happening because he’s getting divorced, and as a father, he really cares about the new rooms of his two daughters. So Ryan focused his showings in this instance on homes with unique, spacious, and cozy kid rooms.

7. Be knowledgeable 
Being able to educate your clients and guide them throughout the process is key to providing best-in-class customer service. Paradoxically, this can eliminate future complaints—and complaints are what we think about when we say “customer service”. So, let’s call being knowledgeable “preventative customer service”.

Bonus: Know your audience
At the time, five years ago, I thought a realtor is a realtor, without being able to distinguish between different types of agents. I told my agent I am going to lease the property. But in hindsight, my realtor worked with home buyers, or mortgage to own, not mortgage to lease (I paid cash, but it’s the mindset and knowledge we’re talking about), and yet he onboarded me even though he didn’t specialize in what I needed.

Knowing who you serve is the foundation of providing them with quality customer service.

Now that you know to focus on communication, expectations, the difference between selling and helping, transparency, empathy, knowing your audience, and how important it is to set up an emergency line, you’re one step ahead of other agents!

6 Things You NEED to Know About QR Code Security
QR codes–we’ve all seen them in store windows, at check-outs, on advertisements. 

‍


Free to use image from Pexels
Once upon a time, they were used by manufacturers to catalog inventory. Now, they’re everywhere, used by businesses, governments, marketers, and individuals alike. 

‍

In today’s world of encroaching technology, QR codes are a bridge between physical and digital space. A QR code acts like a middleman between a physical touchpoint and a digital world, like an auto attendant from Dialpad UK.

What are QR codes and how do they work?
QR stands for Quick Response. QR codes were developed as a successor to bar codes and as such, they can store more information and be processed faster than their predecessors. They represent the next generation of technology, in the same way that business VoIP solutions are a modern replacement for outdated landline technology.

‍

QR codes consist of arrangements of black and white squares that contain encoded data. A smartphone can use a specialised app or its native camera to scan a QR code, parsing the encoded data into a link.

‍

Since their inception, the adoption of QR codes has looked promising, but the COVID-19 pandemic really spurred the need for a contactless system that provided both utility and safety. The spread of QR codes has only grown since then, with new use cases being discovered all the time. 

Why worry about QR code safety?
With mass adoption of new technology come mass security concerns, especially when that technology has become ingrained with words like “tracing”.

‍

One of the major concerns with QR codes is cybersecurity, as they can potentially provide a pathway for hackers to access sensitive information.

‍

Many of us are concerned with how businesses use our data.  


Image sourced from softwareadvice.co.uk
As QR codes have gotten more popular, scammers and hackers have gained more opportunities to scam and hack. As the technology becomes more creative, more useful, and more ingrained in our world, malicious actors have upped their game on new and creative use cases of their own. 

6 things you need to know about QR code security
1. The uses for QR codes are vast
The most important thing to know about QR codes is how far-reaching they are. You might not realise just how many uses QR codes have in our day-to-day lives.

COVID-19 precautions
Governments and businesses alike collaborated to limit the spread of COVID-19. Using massive databases managed by technology like API SAP, COVID-19 testing and contact tracing could be utilised on a massive scale. 

‍

Those databases needed a touchpoint, which is where QR codes really got to shine. 

‍

Whenever possible, people were asked to scan QR codes at restaurants, coffee shops, and healthcare establishments. That data was logged, and if an outbreak of COVID-19 happened at a location, that person could be informed and asked to self-isolate. 

Business cards
Adding QR codes to your printed business cards gives potential clients a quick and easy way to get to know you better. You can link the QR code to a landing page, social media account, video, or your email to facilitate engagement.

‍

You can also eliminate the need for physical business cards entirely by using digital QR code business cards. These allow potential clients to scan the QR code on your smart device instead, which cuts down on environmental waste. 

Tickets
Tickets for concerts, sporting events, and travel can use QR codes to enhance security and lower queuing times. 

‍

A QR code ticket can be quickly scanned and verified as legitimate, avoiding the hassle of someone having to check each and every ticket against a person’s details. This avoids human error, as well as deterring forgeries. 

‍

Since they can be delivered straight to your device, QR codes can also be entirely digital, cutting down on environmental waste.

Booking 
Establishments such as restaurants, hotels, and even healthcare services can use QR codes to facilitate bookings.

‍

Displaying a QR code in a window or on an advertisement offers customers a quick and easy way to make reservations. Instead of having to find a phone number, call a place, and speak to someone, customers can scan the QR code and be taken straight to that business’ booking page. 

‍

And like digital tickets, QR codes can also be used by businesses to verify those reservations.

Scan to pay
New technology strives to make our lives easier, and how we pay for things is a prime example of that.  

‍

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, many stores used QR codes to facilitate payment. Since the pandemic, that process has only gotten more efficient and widespread. Businesses can display QR codes that take customers to secure payment pages to make their purchases–including food and drink establishments, car parks, petrol stations, toll booths, and many more. 

‍

Payment companies like PayPal even allow you to scan QR codes from within their app, offering instant payment. 

Marketing
Adding a QR code to your advertising campaign is a great way to get people engaged with your content. Seeing a QR code on a poster or in a digital ad encourages people to scan, and you can link them to your website, app, social media account, or video content. 

2. QR codes are not intrusive
Now that we understand how significant QR codes can be, it’s important to understand what they are not.

‍

In a world where data collection is so pervasive, many of us worry about our privacy. And then COVID-19 precautions only emphasised the question: is the technology we’re relying on putting us in danger?

‍

Good news! Scanning a QR code does not allow it to steal your data, track your movements, or gain access to your device. The only data QR codes can log themselves is the location of the scan, how many times a QR code has been scanned, and the type of device doing the scanning. 

‍

QR codes are one-way delivery systems that give a device a simple instruction like “go to this webpage” or “open this app”. 

‍

What you do with that instruction is where things can get risky.

3. QR codes take you there–but the rest is on you
QR codes themselves are a data delivery system and cannot take anything from you. A QR code can only lead you to a digital location–a website, a social media channel, an email address, an app store page.

‍

A QR code at a restaurant might take you to a secure payment page, but you need to input your bank details. A QR code on a poster can take you to an app store page, but you need to click “download” to allow that app access to your device. 

‍

It’s important to guard your safety whenever you scan a QR code. Only scan at trusted locations, only download apps you can verify as safe, and don’t input personal details if you’re wary.

4. QR codes can be tampered with
QR codes tend to exist in public places and as such, scammers can easily tamper with them.

‍

The QR code itself cannot be changed, but scammers can create their own QR codes with their own malicious purposes and stick them over existing ones. 

‍

Before you scan a QR code, take a good look at it. If it seems off in any way, don’t use it. 

5. QR codes can contain malicious links
A QR code that has been tampered with, or a QR code in a non-secure environment, can lead to malicious websites or apps. 

‍

For example: you just had a nice meal at your favourite restaurant. Instead of going up to the bar to pay, you choose to scan the QR code that’s printed on your table. It takes you to the business’ secure payment page, you put in your card details, and the transaction completes.

‍

Except some shady character has stuck their own QR code over the restaurant’s. The secure payment page you thought you were accessing is actually a scam page, and you just typed your bank details into it.

‍

Always check any link a QR code is trying to open. If it’s a website, check that site’s security, and never let websites download anything to your device. If it’s an app, has that app been verified by an app store? 

6. Most of the scams involving QR codes use social engineering
The most common way scammers steal is by phishing–putting social pressure on people to willingly give up their personal details.

‍

Phishing is usually done through spam emails, texts, or phone calls. A scammer will reach out to you and either frighten or coerce you into giving them your banking details, answers to password hints, or login credentials.

 

QR code phishing (referred to as quishing) simply cuts out the middleman and takes you straight to the scam. To use the restaurant example again, a malicious QR code can take you to a fake payment page and steal your banking details because you’re already primed to give them up in that scenario. 

‍

We expect stores to have their own apps. If you’re in a store and a QR code claims to take you to that store’s official app, you’re expecting the app to be legitimate; but if a scammer has replaced the legitimate QR code with a malicious one, the app you download could be dangerous. 

‍

QR code scams are like any scam in this regard, and require you to be vigilant about the way you share your data. Never give up personal details to a source you cannot verify. 

To sum up…
QR codes have a place in our lives. They come with exciting new uses and offer utility, bolster security, streamline arduous tasks, and can even keep us safe. 

‍

But, as with any technology, QR codes come with risks. Making your life easier isn’t worth losing your life savings, after all. 

‍

Understanding how QR codes work and keeping a few safety precautions in mind will help you get the best out of QR codes whilst avoiding their pitfalls.

Fast-growing startup Blinq raises $5m to build simple, shareable identities for anyone, anywhere
Blackbird and Square Peg co-invest as Blinq marks rapid growth in users and businesses

MELBOURNE, 17 MAY 2022 — Blinq, a rapidly-growing startup based in Melbourne, has raised AUD$5 million from notable investors Blackbird and Square Peg Capital to revolutionise how professionals share their details and manage ongoing relationships.

“Blinq is one of the fastest-growing platforms we’ve seen in recent years. Just as Twitter and Airbnb took off at events such as South by Southwest, it’s exciting to see Blinq do the same this year,” said Rick Baker, Partner at Blackbird. “The last time Square Peg and Blackbird co-invested in a seed-stage startup, the result was Canva. With many social networks leading to fragmentation of identity, Blinq is creating a way to help people manage, control and share their identities in one place. We see such an exciting opportunity with what Blinq is building.”

Blinq lets you share a snapshot of your professional identity, make great first impressions and manage your ongoing relationships. Blinq replaces business cards and static contact apps with a live profile that can be shared with anyone via QR code, NFC card, short link, email signature or even video call background. With Blinq, you can quickly create multiple profiles to control which information you share, and with whom. Any information you share can be kept up to date so there is no need to inform your contacts when you change numbers, emails or other information.

Early Uber Eats operator and software engineer Jarrod Webb developed Blinq in 2017, observing frustration with paper business cards and the lack of a truly transformative digital option for exchanging contact details. What started as a hobby grew into a substantial opportunity last year as QR code adoption unlocked a reliable way for professionals to quickly share their identity with anyone. In January 2021, Webb left Uber Eats to catch this tailwind and accelerate growth in users and businesses in the post-COVID era. 

“The paper business card has been outdated for decades, but we have never had something that could truly replace it. With QR codes becoming more commonplace during the pandemic, it’s now easier than ever to quickly share your information, manage it from anywhere and keep it up to date,” Webb said. 

Blinq integrates with CRM platforms and directories like Salesforce, HubSpot and Azure AD to provide companies with a single source of truth on contact information, and rich context to help keep their pipeline information up to date and ready for follow-ups.

“The first interaction is the bedrock of a business relationship and with it brings future opportunities. People are using Blinq to enhance that moment of connection,” Webb said.

James Tynan, Principal at Square Peg, said: "The contacts app is essentially the same as it was before the advent of the iPhone. It's time for a connected identity layer that never goes out of date, and we're excited to work with a founder like Jarrod who has the vision and ability to make that future happen."

With the new funding from Blackbird and Square Peg, Blinq is expanding the product team to create new features that help people connect and build successful professional relationships.

About Blinq

Blinq makes it easy for anyone to share their professional identity instantly online or in person, via a digital business card, email signature or video call background. With Blinq, you can quickly create multiple profiles to control which information you share, and with whom. Any information you share can be kept up to date so there is no need to inform your contacts when you change numbers, emails or other information.

Blinq is based in Australia and backed by notable investors Blackbird Ventures and Square Peg Capital.

Frequently asked questions about NFC business cards
How long does it take for a card to arrive?

Once your design has been reviewed, confirmed and approved, we send this off to print. It will take roughly 5-8 business days for our team to print it, encode it and ship it to your door.

Does Blinq require a paid subscription?

No, you can get Blinq NFC Cards without paying for a subscription. However, a lot of our customers choose to upgrade to a premium subscription to access more digital business cards and a range of features like having their logo in their QR code.

Does the person I’m sharing my card with also need to have the Blinq app?

No, the other person doesn’t need to have the app downloaded.

How do I design a custom card?

After you have purchased your custom Blinq card we will send you card template files in SVG and PNG. You can then import these templates into design software such as Photoshop, Illustrator or Canva and add your custom design. Cards will arrive 5-8 business days after your custom design is confirmed. We've written guides on designing cards in Photoshop and designing cards in Illustrator.

Or if you are a Blinq Business or Blinq Premium customer, you are able to request design help from our internal design team. We normally have 2 rounds of revision to help ensure you are happy with your cards before we send them to print!

We print Blinq NFC cards onto an elegant plastic canvas using high quality UV laser printers for a slick finish. We then encode the cards with the information you supply us from your Blinq Profile.

The digital business card that’s always by my side
Gone are the days where I used to provide a business card to a client who then lost it and never called me again. Since using blinq the amount of callbacks I’ve gotten from clients has at least doubled. Customer service has also been fantastic as they helped me set up an enterprise account for my entire business and employees!

The digital business card that’s always by my side
Gone are the days where I used to provide a business card to a client who then lost it and never called me again. Since using blinq the amount of callbacks I’ve gotten from clients has at least doubled. Customer service has also been fantastic as they helped me set up an enterprise account for my entire business and employees!

Frequently asked questions
Are Blinq cards secure?

Each card is given its own unique obfuscated link which cannot be accessed unless someone knows the link, i.e. they receive the card.
‍
All Blinq data is protected by Google Cloud.

Can I create multiple cards for a user?

Yes, you can create different cards ready for different situations. For example, in an internal team meeting where social media links could be shared vs. in a conference setting where only key professional details might be shared. Often, Blinq users create a card with their phone number and another card without their phone number, so they can share the right card for the right situation!
‍
Users can quickly swipe to different cards and share with a recipient depending on the context of the meeting.

How do I upgrade my free Blinq profile to Business?

Go to the Blinq dashboard on a desktop and select Blinq Business to get set up.

What is your privacy policy?

You can view our policy here.

We do not sell your data. We make revenue from subscriptions and sales of NFC accessory products.

Can I program my non-Blinq NFC card or tag to match my Blinq digital card?

Yes, you can reprogram your non-Blinq card or tag to match your Blinq card.

We are going to add this function to our app in the near future but in the meantime, please follow these steps:

First, download an NFC card reader app:
iOS: NFC for iPhone
Android: NFC Tools

Then follow these steps:
1. Open your Blinq app and select the card you want to encode to your NFC card
2. Tap the send button in the bottom right
3. Tap three circles icon in the top right of the page
4. Select "copy link"open your NFC writer app
5. Encode this url onto your NFC object

We look forward to seeing more and more NFC cards and tags running Blinq software!

‍Contact us to find out more and share your NFC card or tag running Blinq on social media with the #BlinqMe hashtag.

Our Privacy Principles
At the core of Blinq's product is the enablement of sharing your information with those you want to share with. As a result, data privacy is critical to the product we offer. At Blinq, we believe in the importance of being able to control who gets that information.

To reflect this importance we've designed our product with made several principles in mind that are intended to protect your data and privacy:

Your data is yours
We don't sell or provide your data to third parties without your consent. It's just not what we do here at Blinq. Your data is yours to share with your network.

Secure Storage
Your data is protected by Enterprise grade encryption and security.

Safe Sharing
Every Blinq Card has a unique code and web address. Those you share your information with will be able to look at your details. If they share your card with others or their company, others may be able to view your details.‍

Introduction
This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you may provide in the "Blinq" mobile application ("Mobile Application" or "Service") and any of its related products and services (collectively, "Services") is collected, protected and used. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you ("User", "you" or "your") and Blinq Technologies Pty Ltd ("Blinq Technologies Pty Ltd", "we", "us" or "our", "Blinq"). Blinq is the company name of the operator of the Blinq Business Card Application ("Blinq"). By accessing and using the Software Applications and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
‍

Automatic collection of information
Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the no logs policy. We may process only minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the Software Applications and Services. Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding the usage of the Software Application and Services. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.

‍

Collection of personal information
You can access and use the Software Application and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the features in the Software Applications, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, make a purchase,  or fill any online forms in the Software Applications. When required, this information may include the following:

- Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.
- Contact information such as email address, address, etc.
- Account details such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc.
- Payment information such as credit card details, bank details, etc.
- Geolocation data such as latitude and longitude.
- Certain features on the mobile device such as contacts, calendar, gallery, etc.

Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Software Applications and Services. However, we may also collect Personal Information about you from other sources such as public databases, social media platforms, third-party data providers, and our joint marketing partners. Personal Information we collect from other sources may include demographic information, such as age and gender, device information, such as IP addresses, location, such as city and state, and online behavioral data, such as information about your use of social media websites, page view information and search results and links. You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features in the Software Applications. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.

‍

Use and processing of collected information
In order to make the Software Applications and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:

- Create and manage user accounts
- Deliver products or services
- Improve products and services
- Send administrative information
- Respond to inquiries and offer support
- Request user feedback
- Improve user experience
- Enforce terms and conditions and policies
- Protect from abuse and malicious users
- Respond to legal requests and prevent harm
- Run and operate the Software Applications and Services

Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Software Application and Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.

Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

‍

Billing and payments
We use third party payment processors to assist us in processing your payment information securely. Such third party processors' use of your Personal Information is governed by their respective privacy policies which may or may not contain privacy protections as protective as this Policy. We suggest that you review their respective privacy policies.

‍

Managing information
You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Mobile Application and Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below. If you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently delete your account, you can do so by contacting us.

‍

Disclosure of information
Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested, we may share your information with your consent with our trusted third parties that work with us, any other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Software Applications and Services available to you. We do not share Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties. These service providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We may share your Personal Information for these purposes only with third parties whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. These third parties are given Personal Information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes.

We will disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your user account, and Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred.

‍

Retention of information
We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.

‍

Transfer of information
Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this Policy or inquire with us using the information provided in the contact section.

‍

The rights of users
You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the right to do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.

‍

The right to object to processing
Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection. You must know that, however, should your Personal Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether we are processing Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of this document.
