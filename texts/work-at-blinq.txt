# Blinq is hiring!

Be part of the fastest growing venture-backed startup in Australia. [Blinq](https://blinq.me/) is the easiest way to share a snapshot of who you are with anyone, anywhere via digital business cards, dynamic email signatures and virtual backgrounds. Our ambition is to become the live identity layer on the internet.

We believe the first interaction two people have is the bedrock of a business relationship. If you can make that experience special, you can start to build a great second interaction, and so on. Blinq will be the tool to help people do that. This is just the beginning.
