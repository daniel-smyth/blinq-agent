Blinq has achieved SOC 2 Type II Certification
MELBOURNE, 14 APRIL 2023 —We are delighted to announce that Blinq has successfully achieved SOC 2 Type II certification. Continuing to demonstrate our commitment to security and the protection of our customers’ data.

SOC 2 Type II certification requires not only that we have security controls in place to protect our customer's data, but that we also have these controls tested by an independent auditor.

We started this process in September 2022 and with support from all areas of the business were able to implement a security management system that was SOC 2 Type II compliant within 6 months.

The attainment of SOC 2 Type II is a testament to the tireless efforts and involvement of everyone at Blinq. We continually strive to be the best-in-class digital business card provider on the market. Our commitment to complying with all applicable privacy laws underscores our dedication to delivering exceptional products and services.
